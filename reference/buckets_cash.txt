# Cash Buckets

Debt buckets can be [added](<buckets.html#create-buckets>), [edited](<buckets.html#edit-buckets>), or [deleted](<buckets.html#delete-buckets>).

Required fields are noted in Red.

Field | Description  
---|---  
Bucket Name | This name will be selected in agreements and referenced throughout the system so the name should be meaningful but kept short if possible. The name is a mandatory field so the bucket cannot be saved if this field has not been populated.  
Currencies | Select one or more Currencies. If this field is left blank then all currencies will be eligible in the bucket.  
  
Cash Collateral Buckets are [audited](<audit.html>) in the standard manner.
