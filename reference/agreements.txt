### Search by Extension Field

If **Search by Extension Field** is selected, extension fields become available in a drop-down box for selection provided the fields are set to be ***Searchable** when they are defined.

**Note:** If no fields are in the drop-down box, then no fields have the checkbox "Searchable" checked in the definition of the extension field.

To Search by Extension Field:

  1. In the Extension Field Value field, select the corresponding Extension Field Value to use as a filter when searching for Agreements.
     1. The Extension Field Value field alters according to the underlying data type of the Agreement Extension Data field. For example, if the data type is date, then Extension Field Value selector will turn into a date picker.
     2. If the Data Type for the chosen Extension Definition is alphanumeric, wildcards can be used when entering a value into the Extension Field Value field.
  2. If the Agreement Extension Data definition field selected has a Null value, enable the Search for Missing Values radial button.

## Agreements Grid View

When data is returned on the Agreements screen, the main page will display the following fields in a grid format:

Field | Description  
---|---  
Actions | There are five options under the Actions column.  
  
| Action| Description  
---|---  
[View Agreement](<#view-agreement>)| Clicking on the magnifying glass will open the agreement selected into a view mode of the [agreement details](<agreements_general.html>).  
[View Exposure Trades](<#view-exposure-trades>)| This will expand the screen below the agreements grid and display the exposure trades for the agreement.  
[View Collateral Positions](<#view-collateral-positions>)| This will expand the screen below the agreements grid and display "live" collateral positions and Movements for the agreement. It includes settled positions as well as collateral movements with a settlement state of "In Transit" and "Failed", and the market values displayed are calculated using the latest eligibility state and the latest price and FX rate data.  
[View Principal Concentration Results](<#view-concentration-results>)| This will expand the screen below the agreements grid and display all concentration rules that are applicable when the Principal is holding the collateral. This applies to the rules which have been defined for the agreement with the "Applies To Party" option set to either Principal or Both.  
[View Counterparty Concentration Results](<#view-concentration-results>)| This will expand the screen below the agreements grid and display all concentration rules that are applicable when the Counterparty is holding the collateral. This applies to the rules which have been defined for the agreement with the "Applies To Party" option set to either Counterparty or Both.  
[Run Single Margin Calculation](<#run-single-margin-calculation>)| Allows for an adhoc margin calculation to be run on one agreement.  
[New From...](<#new-from>)| Allows an agreement to be copied.  
Locked for Approval (Locked icon) | If [Approvals](<agreements_approvals.html>) has been [enabled](<system_configuration.html#database-approvals>) and there are pending changes on the Agreement that require approval, a locked icon will appear in this column. The agreement cannot be edited or copied. "Locked due to pending approval" will be displayed when hovering over the icon. The details of the [pending changes can be viewed](<approvals.html>).  
Agreement Name | The agreement name that meets the search criteria.  
Agreement Type | This value is limited to the [agreement type](<reference_related_data.html#agreement-types>) which is defined against the business line of the agreement.  
Counterparty | The associated entity defined as a counterparty.  
Principal | The associated entity defined as a principal.  
PML  | Principal Managing Location is the city which is responsible for managing the agreement. The city is used to calculate dates and times that are used and displayed for Margin Call and Interest Processing throughout the system.  
  
Additionally, this field is used to calculate local time for the time zone that is applicable to the Principal for Notification Time if standard notification timezone is selected for use.  
  
**Note:** As Principal Managing Location governs the time stamps applied to Margin Calls and Interest Calculations, caution is recommended if it is changed when open margin calls / Interest Payments exist.  
  
Should the Managing Location change and a Margin Calculation Result is in the Margin Workflow - the Calculation Date / Time on the Margin Call item will update automatically to reflect the revised Principal Managing Location. This may mean that the item is expired from certain states, depending on where in the Workflow it happens to be.  
  
The behavior for Interest Payments / Accruals is somewhat different. If the Principal Managing Location is amended on an Agreement after the Interest Calculation Task has been run, the revised Principal Managing Location time-stamps are not applied. It is therefore necessary to manually recalculate Interest Accruals/Payments for the affected Agreement to update the Interest item correctly.  
Ccy | This is the agreement currency which is the base currency in which all calculations will be made for the agreement.  
Business Line | TLM® Collateral Management license use is governed by Business Line.  
  
Business Lines available are OTC, Repo, Securities Lending, Central Clearing.  
  
**Note:** The use of Client Clearing functionality may require an additional license.  
Margin Type | Determines what form of margin requirement and collateral can be associated to the agreement. It determines what Margin Term Parameter Methods can be set. Whether Agreement Level Margins can be defined and whether exposure trades can be loaded on to the Agreement.  
  
Exposure trades can only be imported when the value is set as Variation.  
  
Client Clearing and Lock Up Only Agreements has two choices available: Lock Up and Variation.  
  
Central Clearing Agreements has four choices available: LockUp, Variation, Surplus and Guarantee.  
Status | There are three options for the status:  
  
**Active** \- This is the default for new agreements. All active agreements are subject to Margin Calculations.  
  
**Inactive** \- Agreements that are in this status are not subject to the Margin Calculation task, nor can they be subject to single margin calculation task.  
  
**Monitor** \- Agreements in this status are subject to Margin Calculations, but will always result in No Action Margin Calculation Results. Additionally, the No Action result will have a No Action Type of "Agreement Status of Monitor".  
Agreement Group | A Combined Business Line [Agreement Groups](<reference_related_data.html#agreement-group>) that is used to group together Collateral Agreements so that bulk processing of Margin Calls and Interest Payments for Agreements within the OTC and Client Clearing Business line can be facilitated within TLM® Collateral Management.  
  
For example, a Fund Manager may be responsible for managing the collateral requirements across a number of Funds (typically a separate Collateral Agreement would be in place for each Fund), and wishes to bulk process Margin Calls and Interest Payments.  
  
Agreement Groups provide a mechanism of grouping together these "Funds" for bulk processing.
