The screen is split into three specific sections for each of the groups of data which can currently be overwritten:

Section | Fields | Description  
---|---|---  
Exposure Overrides | Source | This will display the source system of where the trade originated from.  
| Exposure Amount | Under the Original Value, this will be the original PV or MtM of the trade. The user can enter a new value under the Updated column.  
| Exposure Currency | Under the Original value, this will be the currency that the original exposure is specified in. The user can select from the drop down a new currency under the Updated column.  
| Exposure Date | The exposure date to which the Exposure Amount corresponds can be amended by selected a date under the Updated column.  
| Exposure Overrides Expire On | When a manual update is made, a corresponding **Expiration Date** must be entered. This is to determine whether the update should remain attached to the trade or whether it should be allowed to be overwritten the next time a Trades or Overrides file (containing the corresponding trade) is loaded.  
  
Once an override has been locked against a particular trade it will not be updated if a subsequent overrides file contains a value for the locked override field(s) for that trade. See [validation message number 158](<validation_messages.html#158>).  
|  |   
Additional Margin Overrides | Source | This will display the source system of where the trade originated from.  
| Additional Amount | The original additional amount and method will be displayed under the original column. The user can select from the drop down to modify the method and specify a new additional amount under the Updated column.  
| Additional Currency | The currency in which the original additional margin is quoted. The user can select from the drop down a new currency under the Updated column.  
| Additional Due To | The party to which the original additional margin is due. The user can select from the drop down and select a new value, either Principal or Counterparty, under the Updated column.  
| Additional Overrides Expire On | When a manual update is made, a corresponding **Expiration Date** must be entered. This is to determine whether the update should remain attached to the trade or whether it should be allowed to be overwritten the next time a Trades or Overrides file (containing the corresponding trade) is loaded.  
  
Once an override has been locked against a particular trade it will not be updated if a subsequent overrides file contains a value for the locked override field(s) for that trade. See [validation message number 158](<validation_messages.html#158>).  
Lock Up Overrides | Source | This will display the source system of where the trade originated from.  
| Lock Up Amount | The original lock up amount and method will be displayed under the original column. The user can select from the drop down to modify the method and specify a new lock up amount under the Updated column.  
| Lock Up Currency | The currency in which the original lock up margin is quoted. The user can select from the drop down a new currency under the Updated column.  
| Lock Up Due To | The party to which the original lock up margin is due. The user can select from the drop down and select a new value, either Principal or Counterparty, under the Updated column.  
| Lock Up Overrides Expire On | When a manual update is made, a corresponding **Expiration Date** must be entered. This is to determine whether the update should remain attached to the trade or whether it should be allowed to be overwritten the next time a Trades or Overrides file (containing the corresponding trade) is loaded.  
  
Once an override has been locked against a particular trade it will not be updated if a subsequent overrides file contains a value for the locked override field(s) for that trade. See [validation message number 158](<validation_messages.html#158>).  
Comment | Comment | When a manual update is performed, a comment is required. The comment is added to the audit record.  
  
The **Original Value** column displays the values for the above parameters which were loaded by an OTC Trades Import Configuration file. The Source field identifies the name of that Import Configuration.

The **Updated Value** column displays the amended values for those parameters which have been changed, either by an Exposure Trade Overrides Import Configuration file or manually by a user. Where the override was made as a result of an import, the name of the Exposure Trade Override Import Configuration which made the last change is displayed. Where the change was made manually this field displays the word "Manual".

**Date Considerations**

  * Override values on exposure trades can be imported. During import, a validation is done to establish that the exposure trade has not already been manually overridden. This is done by looking at the expiration date of the override.
  * When an override is entered manually, the expiration date that is entered is based on the date on the Principal Managing location of the agreement that the trade is assigned to.

For example, if trade 10005 is assigned to Agreement A Bank which has a Principal Managing Location of Tokyo, then a manually entered expiration date of 5th Feb 2009 means 5th Feb 2009 in Tokyo.

This has the following considerations:

    * If the Principal Managing Location on the Agreement that the Trade is assigned to is changed to a Principal Managing Location with a different time zone, the expiration date that is used for import validation is as per the original Principal Managing Location.

To exemplify, Trade 10005 is assigned to Agreement A Bank The manually entered expiration date was 6th Feb 2023, which equates to 6th Feb 2023 Tokyo time due to A Bank Agreement Principal Managing Location being Tokyo.

If the Principal Managing Location of A Bank was changed to London - the override maintains the 6th Feb 2023 Tokyo time expiration for import validation purposes.

    * If the trade gets assigned to a different Agreement which has a Principal Managing Location with a different time zone, then again the expiration date used during import validation remains based on the original Agreement's Principal Managing Location when the manual input was done.




**Note:** Exposure Trades can be imported for Central Clearing and Client Clearing Agreements (when the corresponding Agreement is defined with Margin Type of Variation) However Margin Calculations for Client Clearing Agreements always ignore Additional Margin and Lock Up Amounts defined on exposure trades. Therefore, although it is possible to override Additional Margin and Lock Up amounts, the value will not be used in Margin Calculations. It is worth noting that Margin Calls are not calculated within the system for Central Clearing Agreements, but are imported.

Where the override was made as a result of an import, the name of the Exposure Trade Override Import Configuration which made the last change is displayed. Where the change was made manually this field displays the word "Manual".

**Date Considerations**

  * Override values on exposure trades can be imported. During import, a validation is done to establish that the exposure trade has not already been manually overridden. This is done by looking at the expiration date of the override.

  * When an override is entered manually, the expiration date that is entered is based on the date based on the Principal Managing location of the agreement that the trade is assigned to.

For example, if trade 10005 is assigned to Agreement A Bank which has a Principal Managing Location of Tokyo, then a manually entered expiration date of 6th Feb 2023 means 5th Feb 2023 in Tokyo.

This has the following considerations:

    * If the Principal Managing Location on the Agreement that the Trade is assigned to is changed to a Principal Managing Location with a different timezone, the expiration date that is used for import validation is as per the original Principal Managing Location.

To exemplify, Trade 10005 above is assigned to Agreement A Bank The manually entered expiration date was 5th Feb 2009, which equates to 5th Feb 2009 Tokyo time due to A Bank Agreement Principal Managing Location being Tokyo.

If the Principal Managing Location of A Bank was changed to London - the override maintains the 6th Feb 2023 Tokyo time expiration for import validation purposes.

    * If the trade gets assigned to a different Agreement which has a Principal Managing Location with a different time zone, then again the expiration date used during import validation remains based on the original Agreement's Principal Managing Location when the manual input was done.



## View Collateral Positions

**Procedure**

  1. In the Navigation Pane, click Agreements and search for the specific Agreement.
  2. Select the ![dotdotdot.jpg](Images/dotdotdot.jpg) icon and a menu will appear.
  3. Select the **View Collateral Positions** and a grid will open up at the bottom of the page.



The grid contains a "live" view of the Collateral Position and Movements for the Agreement. It includes "Settled" positions as well as collateral movements with a settlement state of "In Transit" and "Failed". The market values displayed are calculated using the latest eligibility state and the latest price and FX rate data.

Positions are grouped according to Instrument Reference, Held/Posted, State, Margin Type and Asset Pool.

The fields displayed in the grid are listed below in the default display order:

Field | Description  
---|---  
Actions | There are two options under the Actions column.| Action| Description

At the bottom of the grid, **Total Held** and **Total Posted** provide sum totals of the Mkt Val (Agmt) values for Held and Posted by Instrument. (Settlement State and Margin Type delineations are ignored.)

**Note:** The positions displayed in this grid use the latest Dirty Prices and Price Quote types for the Price Source defined in the agreement, together with the latest FX rates, and Valuation Percentages to calculate Market Value figures.

## View Concentration Results

When Principal or Counterparty Concentration Results is selected, it will present a new grid below the agreements and display all concentration rules that are applicable.

When the agreement has the "Applies to Party" option set to either Principal or Both, this will be applied to the collateral being held by the Principal. If the "Applies to Party" is set to Counterparty or Both, this will be applied to the collateral being held by the Counterparty.

**Procedure**

  1. In the Navigation Pane, click Agreements and search for the specific Agreement.
  2. Select the ![dotdotdot.jpg](Images/dotdotdot.jpg) icon for a specific agreement and a menu will appear.
  3. Select either the **Principal Concentration Results** or **Counterparty Concentration Results**.
  4. The data will be displayed in the grid below the agreements.

Each rule, which has been defined for the relevant party, is displayed with its status using the following symbols:

Symbol | Status | Description  
---|---|---  
![failed_icon.jpg](Images/failed_icon.jpg) | Failed | The limit has not been calculated due to one of the following items of data being missing:  
  
\- FX Rate required in the calculation  
\- Amount Issued or Amount Outstanding (only where these parameters are used in the calculation)  
![warning_icon_mc.jpg](Images/warning_icon_mc.jpg) | Breached | The limit has been calculated and has resulted in a breach situation.  
![run_task_success.jpg](Images/run_task_success.jpg) | Passed | The limit has been calculated and no breach has occurred.  
  
The fields are sorted by the status and displayed in the grid in the following order:

     * Status
     * Rule
     * Description
  5. To view the **Result Details** of the concentration rule, click on the magnifying glass. This will return the status, result and context which are calculated live and displayed below the concentration grid.




**Note:** When calculating concentration results, collateral movements that are in-transit, in progress or failed are considered.

## Run Single Margin Calculation

Typically Margin Calculations are run via a [Margin Calculation task](<task_status.html#margin-calculation>) that uses a Margin Calculation configuration.

Margin Calculation configurations are applicable to at least one business line. They can be additionally filtered by Principal Managing Location(s) or Principal Entities.

While this level of configuration is sufficient for the majority of situations, there may be occasions where it is desirable to run a Margin Calculation for a single Agreement.

TLM® Collateral Management provides this flexibility to run a single Margin Calculation from two places:

  1. Directly from the Agreements screen.
  2. From the [Margin Calculation Task Status](<task_status.html#overview>) screen (provided a single Margin Calculation task for the Agreement in question exists).



**Note:**

  1. There are some restrictions regarding eligibility of certain Business Line's agreements for this functionality.

This functionality is not available to Agreements with the following characteristics:

     * Agreements with a status of Inactive.
     * Agreements for the Central Clearing Business Line.
     * Agreements for the Client Clearing Business Lines which are not associated to a Combined Business Lines Agreement Group.
  2. Changes to agreement group are subject to a caching delay before this information is available to the Agreement screen and this function. If any changes are made to agreement groups, it is recommended to log off and back onto the system to see these reflected.

Should an Agreement have any of the above characteristics, the option for Run Single Margin Calculation will be grayed out.




**Procedure**

  1. In the Navigation Pane, click Agreements and search for the Agreement that needs to be calculated.
  2. Select the ![dotdotdot.jpg](Images/dotdotdot.jpg) icon and a menu will appear. Select the **Run Single Margin calculation**.
  3. A _Margin Calculation Task_ for the selected Agreement is created and queued to be run. 
  4. The Status of the Single Margin Calculation Task can be viewed in the Task Status Screen. 
  5. The Single Margin Calculation Task also saves the exposure trades and collateral positions against the Margin Result. 



**Note:** For Repo and Securities Lending there are two options available to run a single margin calculation. The user can choose **Agreement** which will use values defined under the agreement parameters section of the margin terms during the calculation. Or the user can choose **Internal** which use the values defined under the internal parameters section of the margin terms during the calculation. See [Repo Margin Terms](<marginterms_repo.html>) or [Securities Lending](<marginterms_seclending.html>) for more information.

## New From

The capability of copying an agreement with just a few modifications is possible to do within the system.

**Procedure**

  1. In the Navigation Pane, click Agreements and search for the specific Agreement.
  2. Select the agreement by clicking the ![dotdotdot.jpg](Images/dotdotdot.jpg) icon.
  3. A popup window will appear with all the same data that the copied agreement has except for the following fields/areas:
     1. Agreement Name
     2. Counterparty
     3. Agreement Margins
     4. Contacts
     5. Settlement Instructions



If the "source" agreement that was selected is included in a [Combined Business Lines Agreement Group](<reference_related_data.html#agreement-group>), then the newly created agreement will also be included in the same Agreement Group.

When an Agreement is copied in the above manner, configuration settings determine how the values in the Agreement extension fields are copied over. For example, if the [Copy On New From](<reference_related_data.html#extensions>) check box has been checked as enabled on an [Agreement Extension Reference Data object](<reference_related_data.html#extensions>), then the value that exists on the Agreement selected for copying will be copied over to the new Agreement.

If, however, the same _Copy on New From_ check box, is not checked, then the extension on the new agreement will be populated only with the default value for the extension as defined on the Agreement Extension Reference Data object.

**Note:** If **New From...** is grayed out, it is likely that the Agreement is [Locked for Approval](<agreements.html#agreements-grid-view>) as it contains values that require approval.

An Agreement that is Locked for Approval, cannot be copied. See [Approvals](<approvals.html>) for more details.
