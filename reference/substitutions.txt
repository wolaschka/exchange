# Substitutions

## Background

Substitution recalls are created through the [Positions](<positions.html#create-substitutions>) screen by selecting an Agreement or an Instrument Ref. When selecting an available position, the **Substitute Position** button will be enabled. Once the substitution is created, a notification will appear with a link to the event in the [workflow](<substitutions_workflow.html>). Following this link, the user can then add replacement movements to the substitution.

Created substitutions can be viewed through pre-defined filters: 

  * All
  * Pending 
  * Proposed 
  * In Progress 
  * Approvals 
  * Pending Cpty
  * Confirmed



**Note:** The contents of each of the Substitution Workflow state are filtered according to the following:

  * User's Agreement Scope
  * User's Agreement Responsibility Group
  * User's Agreement Group



In order to be able to see items in Substitution Workflow screens the Agreement must be for a Principal that falls within the user's scope, and is covered by their Agreement Responsibility and/or Agreement Group memberships.

## Search Criteria

Within each workflow filter, the user can view a subset of the substitutions by selecting specific data in the search criteria.

The fields available for searching are the following:

The delivery movements that they have entered on the substitution are worth less than the value of collateral being returned on the substitution. If this is the case the number will be displayed as a negative.  
or  
The delivery movements that they have entered on the substitution are worth more than the value of collateral being returned on the substitution. If this is the case the number will be displayed as a positive.
