# Understanding Audit Records for Eligibility

On an Agreement it is possible to define rules for any of the following five areas:

  1. Basic Eligibility
  2. Advanced Eligibility
  3. Ratings Based Eligibility
  4. Wrong Way Risk Eligibility
  5. Concentration Rules



For ease of explanation, these areas will be referred to as "Rules" in this topic.

Each time one or more of the above Rules is inserted, edited or deleted on an Agreement, a single audit records is created on the Agreement Object.

Although there is a single audit record created, it does however have two elements to it.

The following is an example of how these audit records are displayed. Although the example is for an Advanced Eligibility Rule, an identical process occurs for Basic Eligibility, Ratings Based Eligibility and Concentration Rules.

**Example**

An Advanced Eligibility Rule was created:

"Test AE Rule - Amnt Issued must be greater than 12MM" on Agreement A Bank.

This appears in the audit records as per the below screenshot.

Although a single audit records is created for this, there are two elements.

  1. The Agreement to which the Rule is associated.

If the Agreement already exists and the Rule is being Inserted or Updated, the Audit record for the Agreement is for an Update Action.

If the Agreement does not yet exist and is being newly created together with the Rules - then the audit record for the Agreement is an Insert Action This section details the user who created (and if Approvals are on - the user who approved) the rule.

  2. The Rule itself.

The audit record shows a second subsection section containing An Insert record for Advanced Eligibility Rule, which shows the creation of the AE Rule itself. The main body of the audit record shows in the After Values column, the parameters of the Advanced Eligibility Rule that were entered.

In terms of the second element of the audit record which pertains to the Rule itself, again, these have an Action Type which is shown in the title.

Generally, if the Rule is being applied to the Agreement for the first time, the action is an **Insert**.

If the Rule exists on an Agreement but is being altered, the action is an **Update**.

If the Rule is being removed, the action is a **Delete**.

There is one exception to this - adding or altering Eligible Collateral buckets on an agreement is an **Update** action always.




**Note:** Audit records for contacts are subject to Agreement Scope filtering. This means that the audit details may affect Associated Agreements that are outside of your Agreement Group scope, and therefore permission to see them is not granted.

See [Understanding Agreement Scopes and Agreement Responsibility Groups](<understand_scope_responsibility.html>) for more details.
