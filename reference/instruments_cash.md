# Cash Instrument

When a cash instrument is viewed, created or edited, it will contain 2 tabs of information. Each tab is described below.

**Note:** Fields in red are required.

## General

Field | Description  
---|---  
Currency | Select the Currency from the drop-down list. This will be used as the PrimaryID and displayed accordingly. New currencies can be added through [reference data](<reference_related_data.md#currencies-and-fx-rates>).  
Instrument Type | User defined value which is used to group types of instruments together.  
Cost of Funding | Allows the user to optionally record a numeric value which represents the internal cost of funding the instrument. This field can accommodate 19 digits which includes 2 decimal places.  
Description | A free form field where a written representation of the instrument can be specified.  
  
## Extensions

The system provides the flexibility for users to create their own parameters on the Instrument Object. These parameters are termed "Extensions".

[Instrument Extensions](<reference_related_data.md#extensions>) are created in [Reference Data](<reference.md>). Once created, they can be seen, and their values updated on the Extensions Tab on the Agreement form.
