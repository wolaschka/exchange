# Understanding Parent Entity Relationships

## Overview

The system allows for Entities to have Parent/Child Entity hierarchies.

This is achieved via the Parent field on the Entity form. The following rules govern Entity Parent/Child relationships.

  * Parent is an optional field for an Entity. That is, it is not mandatory.
  * The Parent for an Entity can be of any Entity type - it does not necessarily have to be the same entity type as its child.
  * A Parent can have several Child Entities.
  * A Child Entity can have only one Parent Entity.
  * Entity hierarchy allows for multiple tiers - that is the Parent of an Entity can itself be the child of another Entity.
  * Notwithstanding the above, circular relationships are not allowed - that is, a Parent Entity cannot have one of its children as its Parent.



The below screen shot shows an example of an Entity Hierarchy that meets the above rule set. At the top of the Hierarchy is Demo Bank Holdings, a Parent for the Entities, Demo Inc and Demo Ltd. Demo Inc is in turn parent for Demo Plc, whereas Demo Ltd is in turn parent for entity Demo llc.

## Entities, Hierarchies and Agreement Groups

Both Principal and Counterparty Entity can be defined as inclusion criteria when [Agreement Groups](<understand_scope_responsibility.html#agreement-responsibility-groups>) are defined. If Counterparty Entity is defined, it is also possible to define whether the descendants of the Counterparty Entity should be included in the Agreement Group. It is worth noting the system "caches" the population of descendants of Counterparty Entities for Agreement Group Purposes. If the Parent / Child hierarchies of Entities are altered in a way that would affect their descendants, then it can take up to 30 minutes for the cache to refresh. This means in practical terms that changes to Entity relationships may not be reflected in affected Agreement Groups for up to 30 minutes.
