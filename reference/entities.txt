# Entities

## Overview

Entities can be viewed by selecting **Entities** from the navigation pane.

They can be defined as one, multiple or all of the following types:

  * Central Counterparty
  * Clearing Client
  * Clearing Member
  * Counterparty
  * Credit Support Provider
  * Custodian
  * Issuer
  * Principal



## Search Criteria

### Search By Entity Filter

There are several ways to return entity data when using the **Search by Entity Filters**.

  1. To return all entities within the entity screen, click on the search button.

  2. To return a subset of entities based on a name within the search field labeled **_Entity Name_** , enter all or part of the entity name. The field is case _insensitive_ and an asterisk can be used as a wild card. Select the search button to return the data.

  3. To return entities that are a specific subset of types, click the drop-down button on **Types**. One, multiple or all types can be selected. This can also be used in conjunction with a wildcard search on Entity names. Select the search button to return the data.




To clear the search criteria, click the **Clear Filters** button.

### Search by Extension Field

If **Search by Extension Data** is selected, extension fields become available in a drop-down box for selection provided the fields are set to be ***Searchable** when they are defined.

**Note:** If no fields are in the drop-down box, then no fields have the checkbox "Searchable" checked in the definition of the extension field.

To Search by Extension Data:

  1. In the Extension Field Value field, select the corresponding Extension Field Value to use as a filter when searching for Entities.
     1. The Extension Field Value field alters according to the underlying data type of the Entity Extension Data field. For example, if the data type is date, then Extension Field Value selector will turn into a date picker.
     2. If the Data Type for the chosen Extension Definition is alphanumeric, wildcards can be used when entering a value into the Extension Field Value field.
  2. To search for entities with a null value within the specific extension field, then select the Missing radial button and click the Search button.

The entity grid can be [sorted](<grid_features.html#sorting>), [paged](<grid_features.html#paging>), [exported](<grid_features.html#export-grid>), [reorder columns](<grid_features.html#reorder-columns>), and fields can be [disabled or resized](<grid_features.html#display-and-resizing-columns>).
