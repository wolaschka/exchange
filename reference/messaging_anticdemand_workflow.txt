# Anticipated Demand Workflow

## Behavior for Messaging Margin Calls

This topic outlines the behavior for Anticipated Demands in the standard margin call workflow that are subject to electronic processing with Acadia via the TLM® Collateral Management Messaging Adapter

The following **Anticipated Demand** Workflow states have specific behavior exhibited when processing messaging eligible demands:

## Unsent SVA Anticipated Demands State

Initially, all Messaging Eligible Anticipated Demands Margin Calls generated for Agreements where the Principal is set as the [Valuation Agent](<agreements_general.html>), are contained within the Unsent SVA Workflow state.

When one or more Antic Demands are selected and the **Send Call(s)** button is clicked, the following happens:

  1. TLM Collateral Management publishes notification messages for the selected items.

**Note** : These are not margin call notification messages.

  2. In turn, the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter "Adapter" subscribes to these notifications messages.

  3. For any margin call where the Agreement has been configured with an [Agreement Short Name plus Agreement Currency against a group alias](<messaging_agmt_link.html>) the Adapter takes the Margin Call information and sends an electronic notification to Acadia.
  4. An email margin call notice is also sent to any of the Agreement contacts defined to receive it. That is, even Messaging Eligible margin calls will also email margin call notices to those [contacts on the Agreement](<contactinfo.html#contact-information>) that are defined to receive it.
  5. Simultaneously, within TLM Collateral Management the selected margin call(s) are transitioned into the **Sent - SVA** workflow state to await, and process, the Counterparty's message response.



## Sent SVA Anticipated Demands State

While in this workflow state, [messaging eligible](<messaging_margincalls.html#messaging-eligibility>) Anticipated Demands can be processed automatically by incoming electronic messages from Counterparties that are received via the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter

That is, Counterparties can send their Demands through Acadia and the TLM Collateral Management will [match](<messaging_margincalls.html#margin-call-matching-criteria>) and automatically process the received electronic demand, and respond accordingly.

If the notification was not received by the Counterparty, the **Resend Call(s)** button can be used to send the notification message _again_. However, when this is done, TLM Collateral Management will not check whether it has already been sent, which may result in duplicate notifications being issued, so it is recommended to use this with caution.

As the Principal, has calculated an Anticipated Demand, there are four main scenarios of how a corresponding incoming Counterparty Demand can be processed:

  1. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's Antic Demand Call which the Principal agrees to in _full_.
  2. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's Antic Demand Call which the Principal agrees partially to.
  3. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's Demand margin call.
  4. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's No Action margin call.



All of these scenarios are processed automatically.

How these scenarios are processed in this workflow state is identical to how they would be processed if they were in the **Anticipated Demands** state, so please see the Anticipated Demands section later in this topic for worked examples.

**Note:** Anticipated Demands in this Workflow state can be affected by margin recalculations on the same day that generate differing Margin Calculation Results. If New Margin Result is used - see [Recalculations for Messaging Margin Calls](<messaging_recalc_mc.html>) for messaging specific behavior.

## Anticipated Demands State

Initially, all Antic Demands are contained within the **Anticipated Demands** Workflow state.

While in this workflow, state, [Messaging Eligible](<messaging_margincalls.html#messaging-eligibility>) Anticipated Demands can be processed automatically by incoming electronic messages received via the Acadia interface.

Counterparties can send Demands through via Acadia messaging, and TLM Collateral will match and automatically process the received electronic demand message accordingly.

As the Principal, has calculated an Anticipated Demand, there are four main scenarios of how a corresponding incoming Counterparty Demand can be processed:-

  1. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's Antic Demand Call which the Principal agrees to in _full_.
  2. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's Antic Demand Call which the Principal agrees _partially_ to.
  3. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's _Demand_ margin call.
  4. The Incoming Counterparty Call is matched to a Principal's _No Action_ margin call.



All of these scenarios are processed automatically by messaging integration.

**Scenario 1:** The Principal agrees in full to the electronic Counterparty Demand received by messaging

When TLM Collateral Management matches an incoming margin call to an Anticipated Demand which can be fully agreed to (i.e, **Cpty Margin Call Amount** <= **Prin Call Amount**) the following happens:

  1. A **Fully Agreed** message is published and passed onto Acadia via the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter.
  2. For matched calls, the Counterparty Margin Details will be populated as per details received from Acadia:

Acadia Margin Call Data updated in TLM Collateral Management

Acadia Value | View Collateral Value  
---|---  
Counterparty Mark to Market | Net Exposure; Net Exposure favour of  
Counterparty Initial Margin | Lock Up Margin; Lock Up Margin favour of  
Counterparty Collateral Balance | Held / Posted Collateral  
  3. The **Agreed Total Amount** is set to the **Counterparty Call Amount**.

  4. The Anticipated Demand is transitioned to the **Sent Awaiting Collateral Details** State.



**Scenario 2:** The Principal agrees _partially_ to the electronic Counterparty Demand received by messaging

When TLM Collateral Management matches an incoming margin call to an Anticipated Demand which can be partially agreed to (i.e, **Cpty Margin Call Amount** > **Prin Call Amount**) the following happens:

  1. A **Partially Agreed** message is published and passed onto Acadia via the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter.
  2. For partial agrees, a dispute item is created for the non agreed element and transitioned to the Dispute state.
     1. _Dispute Categories_ and _Dispute Comments_ are published back to Acadia using _categories_ and _comments_ defined in the TLM Collateral Management Windows _service config file_.
     2. Dispute Amount is populated with the difference between the **Cpty Call Amount** and **Agreed Total** Amount.
  3. For the partially agreed element of the Anticipated Demand, the **Total Agreed** is set with Principal Call Amount and is transitioned to the **Anticipated Demands - Agreed** workflow state.
  4. Additionally, as the call was matched , the Counterparty Margin Details in TLM Collateral Management on the Anticipated Demand will be populated as per details received from Acadia:

Table 2. Acadia Margin Call Data updated in TLM Collateral Management

Acadia Value | View Collateral Value  
---|---  
Counterparty Mark to Market | Net Exposure; Net Exposure favour of  
Counterparty Initial Margin | Lock Up Margin; Lock Up Margin favour of  
Counterparty Collateral Balance | Held / Posted Collateral  



**Scenario 3:** The received Counterparty Margin Call message is matched to a Principal's Demand Margin call

When TLM Collateral Management matches an incoming margin call to an Demand (i.e. completely different call type) the following happens:

  1. For the TLM Collateral Management Demand, the Total Agreed is set to zero and the call is transitioned to the Demands - Disputes workflow state
     1. Dispute Amount is populated with the absolute difference between the Cpty Call Amount and Principal Call Amount.



**Scenario 4:** The received Counterparty Margin Call message is matched to a Principal's No Action Margin call

When TLM Collateral Management matches an incoming margin call to an No Action (i.e. completely different call type) the following happens:

  1. A **Full Dispute** message is published and passed onto Acadia via the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter

     1. **Dispute Categories** and **Dispute Comments** are published back to Acadia using **categories** and **comments** defined in the TLM Collateral Management Windows **service config file**.

**Note:** TLM Collateral Management will publish a message for the Full Dispute, but the Adapter will not communicate anything to Acadia as it cannot distinguish between Demand dispute responses from TLM Collateral Management for Outgoing and Incoming calls.

Please see [Messaging: Known Considerations](<messaging_knownconsiderations.html>) for more information.

  2. For the TLM Collateral Management No Action, the **Total Agreed** is set to zero and the call is transitioned to **No Actions - Disputes** workflow state

     1. Dispute Amount is populated with the absolute difference between the **Cpty Call Amount** and **Total Agreed** Amount.



## Agreed State

If Acadia is not configured to send ["suggested"](<messaging_suggestedpledges.html>) pledges to TLM Collateral Management, there are no messaging specific behaviors in this state. As per standard workflow functionality, within this state, the user books the collateral movements in TLM Collateral Management that will satisfy the Anticipated Demand and sends the call with movements attached, for approval to Confirmed to be Approved state.

If Acadia is configured to send ["suggested"](<messaging_suggestedpledges.html>) pledges to TLM Collateral Management, the following occurs:

  1. The "suggested" collateral pledge data is validated within TLM Collateral Management. TLM Collateral Management checks that the instrument exists, as well as whether the pledge direction is valid. If there are any validation errors, TLM Collateral Management does not create the collateral movements, but publishes error messages so that they can be seen in TLM Collateral Management Messaging Intervention Tool.
  2. TLM Collateral Management converts the "suggested" collateral pledge data into Collateral Movements on the Anticipated Demand.
  3. Collateral Movements will only be saved on an Anticipated Demand, if all of the "suggested" pledge information for the Anticipated Demand can be converted into Collateral Movements. If one or more Collateral Movements cannot be created then no Collateral Movements will be saved, and an error will be published. 
  4. Collateral Movements in TLM Collateral Management are created from the "suggested" pledge data using TLM Collateral Management pricing data, namely:

     1. Price details per the Agreements defined price source.
     2. FX details per the Agreements defined Fx Source.
     3. Valuation percentages per the Agreement Basic Eligibility definitions.

The price data received on the "suggested" collateral pledge is written to the **Movement Reason** field for the corresponding TLM Collateral Management Collateral Movement for further analysis if need be.

  5. "Suggested" collateral pledge data will also include three flags from Acadia that will be appended and updated directly on the Anticipated Demand in a single field called **Workflow STP Status**. The individual flags are as follows:

     1. AutoApprovable - true / false
     2. Exceptions - true / false
     3. Overrides - true / false

The Workflow STP Status field is viewable from the Anticipated Demand margin call workflow grid. The field is used by TLM Collateral Management to determine if the Anticipated Demand can be auto approved. See **Confirmed Approval State** section below for more details.

**Note:** These flags are derived solely by Acadia and passed onto TLM Collateral Management via the "suggested" collateral pledge message. Please consult the Acadia documentation for details on how these flags are derived.

  6. TLM Collateral Management then saves the Collateral Movements created against the Anticipated Demand.

**Note: Asset Pool** information is not populated when creating movements (it is not included on the "suggested" pledge message from Acadia as it is an internal TLM Collateral Management data construct.) Should this be needed it will need to be manually added.

  7. TLM Collateral Management then performs the following validations in the order listed:

     1. Existing Movements - checks whether movements already exist on the Anticipated Demand
     2. Insufficient Collateral - checks whether the @Sum **Mkt Value(Agreement Ccy)** value of the created movements is less than the Agreed Total Amount.
     3. Exceeded Collateral - checks whether the **Mkt Value** of the created movements does not exceed the **Agreed Amount + Minimum Transfer Amount** all in Agreement Ccy.
     4. Eligibility - checks whether basic, advanced, ratings based and/or wrong way risk eligibility rules pass.
     5. Concentration - checks whether Principal Concentration rules pass.
  8. If **_all_** the checks in step 7) pass, the process moves on to step 10).
  9. If **_any_** one of the checks in step 7) fail:
     1. The Anticipated Demand will not transition out of the state.
  10. Assuming no further processing or validation errors, the Anticipated Demand with attached Collateral Movements is automatically transitioned to the **Confirmed Approval** state.



## Resetting Agreed Amount

Unless absolutely necessary, it is not recommended to use the reset the agreed amount for calls in this margin call state. Be aware that when the agreed amount is reset in TLM Collateral Management, it will send:

  1. a **Cancel Agreed** message to Acadia if the Anticipated Demand is fully agreed.
  2. a **Cancel Dispute** message to Acadia if the Anticipated Demand is partially agreed.



In either case, the margin call will revert to a Received State in Acadia. When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter re-polls Acadia the margin call will be rematched.

**Note:** Anticipated Demands in this Workflow state can be affected by margin recalculations on the same day that generate differing Margin Calculation Results. If New Margin Results is selected - see [Recalculations for Messaging Margin Calls](<messaging_recalc_mc.html>) for messaging specific behavior.

## Confirmed Approval State

Messaging eligible Anticipated Demands in this Workflow state are subject to either automatic or manual approval as follows:

  1. If the messaging agreement is not eligible for Auto Approvals, the Anticipated Demand will remain in the Confirmed Approval state awaiting manual approval.
  2. If the messaging agreement is eligible for Auto Approvals, TLM Collateral Management then performs the following validations in the order listed:

     1. Eligibility - checks whether basic, advanced, ratings based and/or wrong way risk eligibility rules pass
     2. Concentration - checks whether Principal Concentration rules pass
     3. Workflow STP Status - checks whether the flags received from Acadia allow for the automatic approval of the Anticipated Demand

**Note:** All failures from the above validations will be reported under the Anticipated Demand's Status field. It cannot be determined if the Anticipated Demand should have transitioned to Confirmed Pending Cpty Response just from the Workflow STP Status field. The Anticipated Demand's Status field also has to be reviewed to understand why it has not transitioned.

The below table lists the possible combinations of the above validations and their outcome:

Eligibility Check | Concentration Check | Workflow STP Status field | TLM Collateral Management Transition Behavior  
---|---|---|---  
Fail | n/a  
  
**Note:** Concentration check is executed, but TLM Collateral Management will only report on the first failure. | n/a  
  
**Note:** Workflow STP Status field will have values when provided, but TLM Collateral Management will only report on the first failure. | Anticipated Demand does not auto approve and remains in the **Confirmed Approval** state.  
Pass | Fail | n/a  
  
**Note:** Workflow STP Status field will have values when provided, but TLM Collateral Management will only report on the first failure. | Anticipated Demand does not auto approve and remains in the **Confirmed Approval** state.  
Pass | Pass |  | Anticipated Demand does not auto approve and remains in the **Confirmed Approval** state.  
Pass | Pass |  | Anticipated Demand does not auto approve and remains in the **Confirmed Approval** state.  
Pass | Pass |  | Anticipated Demand does not auto approve and remains in the **Confirmed Approval** state.  
Pass | Pass |  | Anticipated Demand does not auto approve and remains in the **Confirmed Approval** state.  
Pass | Pass |  | Anticipated Demand auto approves and transitions to the **Pending Cpty** Response state.  
Pass | Pass |  | Anticipated Demand auto approves and transitions to the **Pending Cpty** Response state.  



**Note:** Messaging eligible Anticipated Demand auto approvals are only valid within First level movement approvals. This means, if the system is configured for [High Value Movement Approvals](<high_value_movement.html#configure-high-value-movement-approval-evaluation-to-a-business-line>), then all [Second level movement approvals](<high_value_movement.html#understanding-high-value-movement-approval-controls>) will require to be manually approved in order to progress the Anticipated Demand to the **Pending Cpty Response**.

The following behavior occurs when a Messaging Eligible Anticipated Demand is approved in this workflow state.

  1. A **collateral pledge** message is communicated to Acadia via the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter, containing details of the collateral movements that will be satisfying the Margin Call.
  2. TLM Collateral Management will email a collateral confirmation notice to those [Agreement Contacts](<contactinfo.html#contact-information>) which are configured to receive it.
  3. The Anticipated Demand and the collateral movements attached to it are transitioned to Confirmed - Pending Cpty Response State.



## Disputes State

**Resetting Agreed Amount**

Unless absolutely necessary, it is not recommended to reset the agreed amount for calls in this margin call state. Be aware that when the agreed amount is reset in TLM Collateral Management, it will send a **Cancel Dispute** message to Acadia where the call will revert to a Received State. When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter re-polls Acadia, the margin call will be re-matched.

**Note:** Anticipated Demands in this Workflow state can be affected by margin recalculations on the same day that generate differing Margin Calculation Results. If New Margin Result is selected - see [Recalculations for Messaging Margin Calls](<messaging_recalc_mc.html>) for messaging specific behavior.

## Confirmed - Pending Cpty Response

Margin calls may now transition to the **Antic Demands - Confirmed Pending Cpty Response** workflow state from the **Antic Demands - Confirmed to be Approved**. This provides a step in the workflow for the margin call to be updated with the counterparty’s response (accept/reject) to the principal’s proposed margin call movements. Margin calls in this state can be transitioned either via a subscribed message or through the UI.

Anticipated Demands:

  1. If the Counterparty sends a Pledge Accept message, the Margin Call and its attached Collateral Movements are transitioned to **Antic Demands Workflow - Confirmed State**. The movements are updated to a status of In Transit. This completes the margin call processing cycle for the Anticipated Demand in Acadia.
  2. If the Counterparty sends a Pledge Reject message, the Margin Call and its attached Collateral Movements are transitioned to **Antic Demands Workflow - Agreed Awaiting State**. The movements are updated to a status of Rejected, and a message is sent to the Counterparty via Acadia cancelling the movements. The movements are cancelled so that any changes that are made by the user in the Agreed-Awaiting Collateral Details state and then approved will send the movements as new movements to the Counterparty via Acadia.
