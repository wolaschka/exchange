# Upcoming Coupons

## Overview

The majority of debt Instruments (bonds) that are provided as collateral to satisfy margin requirements pay a coupon (interest) at predefined frequencies (typically twice a year) to the bond owner. The date on which the coupon is due to be paid is known as “Coupon Date”.

The establishment of whom the bond owner is for the purposes of paying the coupon on coupon date is determined on a date known as "Record date". Record date is a date prior to the coupon payment date. Whoever owns the bond at close of trading on record date will receive the upcoming coupon payment on coupon date irrespective of who is actually holding the bond on that date.

The "ex-date" is the date on which the seller, and not the buyer, of an instrument will be entitled to a recently announced coupon. The ex-date is usually two business days before the record date.

The payment of the coupon can have ramifications for Collateral Practitioners:

  * The coupon payment will affect the value of collateral.
  * There are operational processes involved in processing the coupon.
  * There may be tax implications of being the bond holder at record date or coupon date.



Many Collateral Practitioners therefore wish to know in advance that bonds in their Collateral Inventory, whether held or posted, are due to pay coupons. They can then best decide how they wish to process the upcoming coupon event.

The Inventory Management Module provides functionality to deal with upcoming coupons:

  * Collateral Positions in Bonds that are due to pay a coupon can be identified.
  * [Substitutions](<#create-substitution>) can be created for positions in those bonds that are due to pay a coupon.



## Search Criteria

To identify upcoming coupons on Collateral Positions, filters can be applied to return a subset of specific data within the following parameters:

Field | Description  
---|---  
Principal | By default, all principals within the user's [Agreement Scope](<understand_scope_responsibility.html#agreement-scope>) will be returned unless specific principals are selected from the drop-down. The selectable principals within the drop-down is based also based upon the user's [Agreement Scope](<understand_scope_responsibility.html#agreement-scope>).  
Coupon Date | This is the date on which the debt instrument coupon is paid. If this is the date that should be included in the filter criteria, then click the radial button.  
Ex-Date | This is the date on which the seller, and not the buyer, of an instrument will be entitled to a recently announced coupon. If this is the date that should be included in the filter criteria, then click the radial button.  
From | The start date for the range to search in terms of either the Next Coupon or Ex-Dates. By default, the value will be today's date.  
To | The end date for the range to search in terms of either the Next Coupon or Ex-Dates. By default, the value will be today's date plus 10 calendar days.  
  
This filter will be applied after pressing the **Search** button.

To clear the fields, click on the **Clear Filters** button.

## Grid Features

The coupons grid can be [sorted](<grid_features.html#sorting>), [paged](<grid_features.html#paging>), [exported](<grid_features.html#export-grid>), [reorder columns](<grid_features.html#reorder-columns>), and fields can be [disabled or resized](<grid_features.html#display-and-resizing-columns>).

## Grid View

The grid will populate with held and/or posted Collateral Positions per Agreement in any bonds which match the above search criteria within the inclusive date range specified.

By default, the grid contents will be sorted by:

  * Coupon Date (Ascending Order)
  * Instrument Reference
  * Agreement Name



The following information is displayed in the grid by default: 

Field | Description  
---|---  
Agreement Name | The Agreement which has the collateral position.  
Principal | The Principal on the Collateral Agreement.  
Counterparty | The Counterparty to the Collateral Agreement.  
Held/Posted | Indicates which party holds the collateral position:  
  
**Held:** The Position is held by the **Principal**.  
  
**Posted:** The Position is held by the **Counterparty**.  
Margin Type | Indicates which margin requirement the collateral position is defined to be allocated toward.  
  
There are two possible values:  
  
**LockUp:** collateral positions of this type should only exist for [OTC Agreements that separate Lock Up and variation requirements](<agreements_general.html#collatallocation>) or for [OTC Lock Up Only agreements](<agreements_define.html#otc-lock-up-only>). Where this is the case, collateral of this type is only ever allocated toward lock up margin requirements.  
  
If collateral positions for this margin type exist any other agreement type, they are treated are variation collateral for margin calculation purposes.  
  
**Variation:** for OTC agreements that don't segregate collateral positions, and for Repo and Securities Lending Agreements, collateral positions should always be for a Margin type of variation. Collateral for a margin type of variation is automatically allocated toward lock up requirements (if there are any) first, and then variation requirements.  
  
Where collateral of this margin type exists for [OTC Agreements that separate Lock Up and variation requirements](<agreements_general.html#collatallocation>) the collateral is only ever allocated toward variation requirements.  
  
**Note:** Collateral is segregated by margin type for purposes of calculating available notional above.  
Instrument Ref | The Primary ID of the Instrument with the upcoming coupon. By clicking on the [instrument](<instruments_debt.html#general>), a new tab in the browser will appear landing on the page with the instrument's details where the user can view or edit the details.  
Next Coupon Date | The Next coupon date for the Instrument.  
Settled Notional | This is the current **settled** position for the instrument for the Agreement.  
Available Notional | Available notional is a calculated control figure to prevent users entering collateral return movements in excess of what has been delivered.  
  
It is calculated by taking into consideration certain movements, and is delineated by margin type. That is, available notional will be calculated separately for collateral positions for margin type of lock up to margin type of variation.  
  
The two margin types are not commingled.  
  
It is calculated by taking into consideration certain movements:  
  
A **Held** settled position is adjusted to take into account **Return to Counterparty** movements.  
  
A **Posted** settled position is adjusted to take into account **Return to Principal** movements.  
  
The movements which are used in the adjustment are those which are not in an end state. (This would be [movements entered via](<margin_calls_movements.html>) a Workflow which are either "In Progress", "To Be Approved", "Rejected" or " InTransit" and [manually entered movements](<movements.html#create-a-manual-movement>) which are either "To Be Approved" or "InTransit".)  
  
If there are no such movements, then available notional will be the same as notional.  
  
## Create Substitution

Some Collateral Practitioners may elect to deal with upcoming coupons by substituting the affected bond(s) prior to the Record Date. TLM® Collateral Management allows for substitutions to be created for positions in securities where the coupon is upcoming.

The substitutions can be created directly from the Upcoming Coupons screen. If they are created directly from this screen, the position data in the grid is used to populate the return leg of the Substitution.

This saves the operational effort and potential error of having to create and populate this manually.

**Procedure**

  1. To create a substitution, select the position by clicking the radial button next Agreement Name. The **Substitute Position** button will become enabled.
  2. The substitution of Collateral form will open, pre-populated for the substitution return movement with details taken from the highlighted position.
  3. Go to [Create Substitutions from in Positions](<positions.html#create-substitutions>) to see the available fields and complete the substitution.

**Note the following:**

     * Notional to be substituted is pre-populated with the Available Notional amount.
     * Reason for substitution is pre-populated with "Upcoming Coupon."
     * Settlement Date is defaulted as per the configured debt instrument offset for the system.
     * The collateral movements created by the substitution will be for the same Margin Type as the collateral position selected.

Any of the first three values can be amended if required, but will be subject to validation. It is not possible to amend the margin type on the collateral movements created by the substitution.

  4. Click **Save** to save the return movement for the Collateral Substitution.

  5. The Substitution is created, and placed in the _Substitutions Workflow - Pending Substitutions_ sate, with the return collateral movement.

The substitution can be [processed](<substitutions_workflow.html>) as a per any other substitution.

When the user attempts to save the substitution, a series of validations are performed by the system. These validations are identical to those performed if the user had manually created a substitution return collateral movements.
