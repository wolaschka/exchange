## Overview

When Cash Collateral is defined as Eligible Collateral on an Agreement, it is necessary to define the Interest Terms that will be applicable to cash positions that will form cash collateral balance on the Agreement.

It is also necessary to define terms that will be applicable to the actual Interest Payments themselves. These terms are defined at the Agreement level and will be applicable to Interest Payments that are generated for all cash collateral balances in any currency on the Agreement.

**Note:** Interest payment terms can be defined for Agreements of the following Business Lines:

  * OTC / Repo / Securities Lending
  * Client Clearing



Cash can be assigned as eligible collateral on an agreement in two ways:

  1. Cash can be assigned as an eligible instrument to an Agreement.
  2. A cash collateral bucket which contains one or more currencies can be assigned to the Agreement.



## Cash Collateral Interest Terms

When the bucket, instrument or cash is assigned to Eligible Collateral, the corresponding currencies will be added to the Interest tab section.

In the case of a bucket being assigned as eligible collateral, all the underlying currencies from the cash collateral bucket will be added to the Interest Terms.

By default, once a currency/cash bucked has been added as eligible, the cash collateral interest terms will state "No Term Defined" per eligible currency.

### Add Interest Term

See [Adding an Instrument on Basic Eligibility](<basiceligibility.html#adding-a-bucket-or-instrument>).

### Edit Interest Term

**Procedure**

  1. Click on the **Edit** button to modify the agreement.
  2. In the Interest tab, click on the ![edit_icon.jpg](Images/edit_icon.jpg) icon next to the currency that needs modification.
  3. A popup Interest Terms window will appear. Required fields are noted in red. The field descriptions are listed below.
  4. Enter the data under the _Calculation_ section and when the required fields have been filled in, an **Update** button will become enabled.
  5. Click the **Update** button and the values will be applied to the _Details_ section of the grid.
  6. Click the **OK** button to apply the changes.
  7. Click the **Save** button to commit the changes to the agreement.



**Note:** Fields in red are required.

Field | Description  
---|---  
Currency | This is the currency defined from the Eligible Collateral  
Applies To | Interest terms per currency can be uniquely defined at the level of Posted, Held or Both.  
  
Whether terms should apply to cash balances for Variation Margin Type, Lock Up Margin Type or Both Variation and Lock Up Margin type.  
Only applicable on OTC Agreements that segregate Variation and Lock Up Collateral.  
  
Four interest terms can be defined per currency:  
\- **Held Variation** cash balances.  
**\- Posted Variation** cash balances  
**\- Held Lock Up** cash balances.  
**\- Posted Lock Up** cash balances  
  
Where an agreement's collateral allocation type is segregate lock up and variation all four definitions are required.  
  
Where an agreement does not segregate variation and lock up, only the first two definitions are required.  
Index | Select the [Index](<reference_related_data.html#index>) that will be used as the source for Interest Rates  
Spread | Enter the Spread that will be applied to the Index rates. The default is zero. Spread is entered as a percentage to six decimal places of precision. It can be defined as either a negative or positive number.  
  
Example: Entering a spread of 0.15 against an Index that had a current rate of 4.5% would result in an effective rate of 4.65%.  
Calculation Type | Defines how interest will be accrued.  
  
**Note:** Only calculation types 'Simple Allows Negative', 'Compound Calendar Days Allows Negative' and 'Compound Business Days Allows Negative' allow negative effective rates. For the other calculation types, the effective interest rate will be floored at zero if it is a negative number.  
  
The choices are the following:  
  
| Field| Description  
---|---  
Simple| Under this calculation, interest accrues on the cash collateral as follows:  
  
For held positions, interest accrues on the aggregate held notional position per day, according to the applicable effective Held Rate (Held Index Rate plus Held Spread) for that day.(To avoid confusion Held Position means the sum of all Deliver to Principal, and Return to Counterparty movements in a settled or In Transit State)  
  
For Posted Positions, interest accrues on the aggregate posted notional position per day, according to the applicable effective Posted Rate (Posted Index Rate plus Posted Spread) for that day.(To avoid confusion Posted Position means the sum of all Deliver to Counterparty, and Return to Principal movements in a settled or In Transit State)  
  
The Interest accruals are not compounded into either the held or posted notional positions during the Interest Period.  
  
This is sometimes referred to as straight line accrual.  
  
**Note:** Under this interest calculation type, Effective Held Rate and Effective Posted Rate can never be a negative number. Effective Rates will be floored at zero if Index rate plus spread results in a negative number.| Simple Allows Negative| This calculation type is identical to Simple, with the key exception that an effective interest rate is not floored at zero, and can therefore be a negative number.  
Compound Calendar Days| Under this calculation, interest accrues on the cash collateral as follows:  
  
**For held positions** \- Interest accrues on the aggregate held notional position per calendar day, according to the applicable effective Held Rate (Held Index Rate plus Held Spread) for that day (To avoid confusion Held Position means the sum of all Deliver to Principal, and Return to Counterparty movements in a settled or In Transit State).  
  
This "held" interest accrual is compounded per Calendar Day into the held cash balance throughout the Interest Period.  
  
**For Posted Positions** \- Interest accrues on the aggregate posted notional position per calendar day, according to the applicable effective Posted Rate (Posted Index Rate plus Posted Spread) for that day.(To avoid confusion Posted Position means the sum of all Deliver to Counterparty, and Return to Principal movements in a settled or In Transit State)  
  
Similarly, this "posted" interest accrual is compounded per Calendar Day into the posted cash balance throughout the Interest Period.  
  
Interest accruals are therefore compounded into the applicable held or posted balances every day of the week, including on Saturdays and Sundays.  
  
**Note:** Under this interest calculation type Effective Held Rate and Effective Posted Rate can never be a negative number. Effective Rates will be floored at zero if Index rate plus spread results in a negative number.  
Compound Calendar Days Allows Negative| This calculation type is identical to **Compound Calendar Days** with the key exception that an effective interest rate is not floored at zero, and can therefore be a negative number.  
Compound Business Days| Under this calculation, interest accrues on the cash collateral as follows:  
  
**For held positions** \- Interest accrues on the aggregate held notional position per Business day, according to the applicable effective Held Rate (Held Index Rate plus Held Spread) for that day.(To avoid confusion Held Position means the sum of all Deliver to Principal, and Return to Counterparty movements in a settled or In Transit State)  
  
This "held" interest accrual is compounded per Business Day into the held cash positions for the purposes of interest calculation throughout the Interest Period.  
  
**For Posted Positions** \- Interest accrues on the aggregate posted notional position per Business day, according to the applicable effective Posted Rate (Posted Index Rate plus Posted Spread) for that day.(To avoid confusion Posted Position means the sum of all Deliver to Counterparty, and Return to Principal movements in a settled or In Transit State)  
  
Similarly, this "posted" interest accrual is compounded per Business Day into the posted cash positions throughout the Interest Period.  
  
Unless an Index Holiday Calendar has been specified in the Interest Terms - Business Days are defined as Monday to Friday.  
  
If a Holiday Calendar has been specified under the Interest terms - then any applicable Holiday Dates within that calendar will be used to define Non Business Days. When this occurs, the system will compound the interest on the next valid business day.  
  
**Note:** Under this interest calculation type Effective Held Rate and Effective Posted Rate can never be a negative number. Effective Rates will be floored at zero if Index rate plus spread results in a negative number.  
Compound Business Days Allows Negative| This calculation type is identical to **Compound Business Days** with the key exception that an effective interest rate is not floored at zero, and can therefore be a negative number.  
Do Not Calculate Accrual| Under this calculation type, interest is not accrued on any cash balances and Interest Payments are not created.  
  
However, an accrual of direction "Accrual Not Calculated" and an amount of zero is generated per Interest Period when this value is set.  
For more information see [Understanding Interest Calculation Methods](<understand_interest_calc_methods.html>).  
Compound Calendar | If Compound Business Days was selected for Calculation Type, it is possible to define the Holiday Calendar that will be used to determine any Non Business days for the Index.  
  
If no Holiday Calendar is selected, then it will be assumed that there are no Holiday Dates for compounding purposes, and that only weekends will be calculated as Non Business Days.  
Variation Accrual in MC | If the collateral allocation type is **Auto Allocate** , only the Include Variation Accrual check box is shown. If collateral allocation type is Segregate Lock Up and Variation, both the Include Variation Accrual and Include Lock Up Accrual are shown and allowed to be set.  
Lock Up Accrual in MC | If the calculation type is **Lock Up Only** , then the Include Lock Up Accrual checkbox is enabled and allowed to be set. The default value is unchecked and will exclude the accrual value from the Margin Calculation.  
  
The effect of setting these boxes as checked on margin calculations is detailed in [Including Accrued Interest in Margin Calculations](<#including-accrued-interest-in-margin-calculations>).  
  
**Note:** Include options is not available for Client Clearing Agreements  
Net Held and Posted | **Netted** \- The box is checked by default upon creation of a new agreement. When it is checked, it denotes that Interest Accruals and Payments are "netted" within margin types.  
  
Interest is calculated on a per currency per margin type basis. The held and posted interest is calculated separately and the results are added together to create the interest payments and interest accruals.  
  
Netting only occurs per currency within margin types. Interest accrual calculated on held cash positions of margin type variation will never be netted with accruals calculated on cash collateral positions of lock up margin type.  
  
Interest Statements are always created as a single statement per currency, per margin type, when payments are netted. Held and posted positions are split out into separate sections within the Interest Statement.  
  
**Gross** \- When the checkbox is cleared, the accruals and payments are not netted but instead created as "gross".  
  
Interest is calculated on a per currency per margin type basis. The held and posted interest is calculated separately and the results will yield interest payments and interest accruals in both directions.  
  
Separate accruals and payments are always produced while separate interest statements are always created for held and posted positions per currency and margin type.  
Rounding | Rounding Method used in the Interest Calculations.  
  
There are three possible settings:  
Closer  
Down  
Up  
  
The default value is Down.  
  
Rounding Method works in conjunction with Decimal places that is defined on the respective currency.| Decimal Places| Rounding Method| Before Value| After value  
---|---|---|---  
2| Down| 100.1234| 100.12  
2| Closer| 100.1234| 100.12| 2| Up| 100.1234| 100.13| 2| Down| 100.1268| 100.12| 2| Up| 100.1268| 100.13| 2| Closer| 100.1268| 100.13| 2| Closer| 100.125| 100.13| 2| Down| 100.1234| 100| 2| Down| 100.6789| 100| 2| Up| 100.1234| 101| 2| Up| 100.6789| 101| 2| Closer| 100.1234| 100| 2| Closer| 100.5678| 101 | Apply Rounding For | Define if the rounding should be applied to the following:  
**Daily Accruals:** select this option to apply the rounding method and decimal place precision to all elements of the Interest Calculation, namely:  
Daily Interest  
Accrued Interest  
Balance  
Effective Net Balance  
Sub Totals and Final Accrual amounts  
  
**Final Payment Only :** selecting this option will only apply the decimal precision and rounding method to the final interest payments only.  
  
**Note:** Despite no rounding or decimal precision being employed in the interest calculation, for display purposes only within the application and in the Interest Statements, the same elements of the Interest Calculation are displayed using the decimal places defined on the currency.  
Distribution Preference | From the Distribution Preference drop-down, select how interest payments should be distributed. There are two selectable values:  
  
**Roll-In:** by selecting this value, the system will create an Interest Payment amount for the Interest that has accrued during the Interest Period. Once processed, and agreed this agreed Interest Amount will be added to the corresponding cash collateral balance at the start of next Interest Period.  
  
**Distribution:** by selecting this value, the system will create an Interest Payment as a Deliver to Prin or Deliver to Cpty for the Interest amount at the end of the Interest Period. This Payment, once processed and agreed through Interest Workflow will form a physical payment to either the Counterparty or the Principal. The agreed Interest Payment will not form part of the physical collateral balance  
Payment Holiday | Select the Holiday Calendar that will be used to determine any Non Business days for the Index.  
Payment Frequency | See [Define Interest Period End and Frequency](<#define-interest-period-end-and-frequency>)  
  
### Delete Interest Term

**Procedure**

  1. Click on the [Eligibility](<basiceligibility.html>) tab.
  2. To delete an interest term, the corresponding [eligible collateral](<basiceligibility.html#deleting-a-bucket-or-instrument>) must be removed.
  3. Click on the ![delete_icon.jpg](Images/delete_icon.jpg) icon next to the instrument or bucket.
  4. A delete eligibility pop-up will appear asking for confirmation to delete.
  5. Click the **Delete** button to remove the instrument or bucket from eligible collateral.
  6. Then click the **Save** button to commit the changes to the agreement.



## Define Interest Period End and Frequency

Interest Periods are defined in terms of when they end and how frequently they recur. Interest Periods are used in the calculation of accrual amounts and when the Interest accruals should then be transformed into Interest Payments.

The end date for an Interest Period denotes the start point for the next Interest Period. The Interest Period Start Date is always the next calendar date after the Interest Period End Date.

For example, if the Interest Period End Date is specified as being the last calendar date each month, then the Interest Period start date will be the 1st calendar day of the month.

Once an Interest Period End Date has been reached on an Agreement, Interest Payments will be created once the [Interest Calculation Task](<task_interest_calc.html>) next runs with the Generate Payments flag enabled. (e.g., The End Date is less than today.)

The **Payment Frequency** has four values. Depending the choice selected, other fields will become visible to further define the frequency.

**Note:** Fields in red are required.

Payment Frequency | Field(s) | Description  
---|---|---  
Daily |  | The Interest Period will end each Business Day. Business Day is defined as Monday to Friday.  
  
**Note:** Interest Payments generated on a Monday will include accruals for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. No period end date adjustments are currently made for Holidays when Daily Period end dates are defined.  
Weekly | End of Week on | Specify the day of the week (Monday to Sunday) that the Interest Period should end on. The Period will end each week on the day selected.  
  
**Note:** No adjustments are made for Holiday or Non Business days when weekly period end dates are defined.  
  
Example:  
If Wednesday is selected as a weekly period end date, and a particular Wednesday falls on a Holiday Date, the system will not adjust the period end date  
Monthly | Recur Day Type | This allows the day of the month to be specified on which the Interest Period will end. There are three choices. Depending on the value selected will remove or make visible fields.| Value| Fields  
---|---  
Calendar Day| Date \- select a number or "Last"  
  
Months \- select one, multiple or all  
  
**Note:** If Calendar Day is selected for the Period End Date, it is possible to define a date which does not exist for all months, for example 31st. In this case, where a month does not have 31 days the system will use the last calendar day of that month as the corresponding End Date.  
  
If all months are selected with the Calendar Day set as "Last", then the Interest Period will end on the first Business day of each month (subject to any Holiday calendar adjustment), and a new Interest Period will begin on the next calendar day.  
  
If the Interest Period should be for 6 months, beginning on the calendar day after the 1st business day of January, and restarting on the next calendar day after the 1st business day of July, then it should be populated as follows: Note that the start date is not being defined - the end date is.  
Business Day| Date \- select a number or "Last"  
  
Months \- select one, multiple or all  
  
**Note:** If Business Day is selected, the system will use any Holiday Calendar that has been defined in Period Payment Holiday Calendar on Eligibility / Interest tab to determine Non Business Days.  
  
If the day is selected for End date falls on a defined Holiday Day, then the system will use the next available valid Business day as the Period end date. No adjustments are made for Holiday or Non Business days when a specific Calendar day is chosen.  
  
Example: If the 10th calendar day is selected as the period end date, and that date actually falls on a weekend or Holiday date, the system will still use the 10th as the period end date, and will not adjust this.  
Relative Day| Week \- Choose from "First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth" or "Last"  
  
Day \- Choose applicable Day ("Monday" to "Friday")  
  
Months\- select one, multiple or all  
Exact | Dates | This option allows many exact dates to be Interest Period End Dates for the agreement.  
  
Click on a date in the calendar to select it. The date will then appear in the Selected column.  
  
Dates can be removed by clicking on the specific date or to remove all dates, click on the **Clear All** button.  
  
**Note:** No adjustments are made for Holiday or Non Business days when specific dates are defined.  
  
Example:  
If the 24th March is selected as the period end date, and that date happens to fall on a weekend or Holiday date, the system will not adjust the period end date to a valid business date. If the specific end date has been passed, and no others exist, then interest will accrue indefinitely until a new date is entered.  
  
## Including Accrued Interest in Margin Calculations

The system provides the flexibility of specifying whether Margin Calculations should be inclusive of Accrued Interest or not.

Additionally, for OTC Agreements that [segregate Lock up and Variation collateral](<segregate_lockup_varmargin.html#segregated-lock-up-and-variation-margin-agreements-non-auto-allocate>) or have a [lock up only calculation type](<agreements_define.html#otc-lock-up-only>), it is further possible to define whether accruals for a particular collateral margin type (Lock Up or Variation or lock Up Only) should be included in the Margin Calculation.

This behavior is governed by two fields on the Agreement Eligibility Tab:

  * To include variation accruals, enable the check box Include Variation Accrual in Margin Calc.
  * To include Lock Up accruals, enable the check box Include Lock Up Accrual in Margin Calc.



(please note that this field is disabled for any agreement where the collateral allocation value is not Segregate Lock Up and Variation)

By default the check boxes for these fields are cleared, meaning that accrual values on cash collateral balances of any margin type are not taken into consideration as part of the collateral balances in Margin calculations.

If the field is checked, then accrued interest values are included in the Margin Calculation against the corresponding variation or lock up collateral element. That is, accruals on lock up collateral balances can only be included against lock up requirements, and never variation requirements, and vice-versa.

If **Include Variation Accrual in Margin Calc** is checked, the following methodology is used in the inclusion of Variation Accruals:

  1. Accrued Interest is deemed to be any current Open Accruals and non-completed, non approved Interest Payments per currency for the agreement. where the margin type for the accrual and payment is variation. (Note once an Interest Payment for variation margin type is approved, the Interest Movement is included as an In Transit collateral movement under the variation requirement, provided that the Interest payment is a Roll In. Distribution movements are not included once approved.)
  2. Each Accrual per currency from step 1) is aggregated into a single net value in agreement currency using the applicable FX rates.
  3. The resultant net accrual from 2) is stored as a separate value but treated effectively as a collateral position for variation margin type, either held or pledged when the Margin calculations are run.
  4. If the overall net accrual value is Due to Cpty, it will this will effectively increase the Held Collateral Balance in the variation requirement.
  5. Conversely, an overall net accrual value that is Due to Prin, will effectively increase the Posted Collateral Balance in the variation requirement.

Similarly,

If **Include Lock Up Accrual in Margin Calc** is checked, the following methodology is used in the inclusion of Lock Up Accruals:

  6. Accrued Interest is deemed to be any current Open Accruals and non-completed, non approved Interest Payments per currency for the agreement. where the margin type for the accrual and payment is lock up. (Note once an Interest Payment for lock up margin type is approved, the Interest Movement is included as an In Transit collateral movement under the lock up requirement, provided that the Interest payment is a Roll In. Distribution movements are not included once approved) 

  7. Each Accrual per currency from step 6) is aggregated into a single net value in agreement currency using the applicable FX rates.
  8. The resultant net accrual from step 7)is stored as a separate value but treated effectively as a collateral position for lock up margin type, either held or pledged when the Margin calculations are run.
  9. If the overall net accrual value is Due to Cpty, it will this will effectively increase the Held Collateral Balance in the lock up requirement.
  10. Conversely, an overall net accrual value that is Due to Prin, will effectively increase the Posted Collateral Balance in the lock up requirement.
