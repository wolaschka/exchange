# Grid Features

## Sorting

The columns of a grid can be sorted by clicking on the column header.

  * An upward pointer is displayed to indicate that a column is sorted in ascending order.
  * A downward pointer is displayed to indicate that a column is sorted in descending order.
  * To sort by multiple columns, hold down the SHIFT key and then click on the relevant column headers in the order that the sort should apply.



## Paging

The number of rows of data being returned in a grid can be configured. When there are more rows of data to display than have been configured, the system will indicate this by displaying a page number out of a total page number.

**Example:** 1 of 25, this indicates the user is viewing page one of data out of 25 total pages of data.

The user view the next page by clicking on the ![nextpage.jpg](Images/nextpage.jpg) icon.

The user can go back a page by clicking on the ![backpage.jpg](Images/backpage.jpg) icon.

The user can go to the last page of data by clicking on the ![lastpage.jpg](Images/lastpage.jpg) icon.

The user can go back to the beginning by clicking on the ![firstpage.jpg](Images/firstpage.jpg) icon.

The default items per page limit is set at 100 items. The amount of data being returned in a grid can be adjusted to either 25, 50, 100, 250, or 1000 rows.

Grids will display a maximum of the number of items specified for the page, or the remaining number of items in the data set still left to display.

**Example:** Assume that there are 109 items in the data results, and the items per page limit has been set at 50. There will be five pages of data to view in the grid. Four pages will contain 50 items, while the final page will contain nine.

Each time the grid is refreshed, the number of items selected will be refreshed.
