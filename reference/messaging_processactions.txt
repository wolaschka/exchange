# Processing Actions

Actions can be independently initiated in Acadia that may affect Messaging Eligible Margin Calls in TLM® View Collateral. This topic outlines what those actions are, and how they are processed.

## Cancel Agreed / Cancel Dispute

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to **Cancel Agreed** or **Cancel Dispute** , a message will be published to reset the agreed amount. Provided that the Margin Call in TLM Collateral Management is in a workflow state that allows the agreed amount to be reset, it will.

## Cancel Margin Call

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to **Cancel Margin Call** a message will be published to reset the agreed amount of the corresponding call in TLM Collateral Management. Provided that the Margin Call TLM Collateral Management is in a workflow state that allows the agreed amount to be reset, it will.

## Pledge Amend

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to **Pledge Amend** a Demand the system does the following:

  * Analyses the **Pledge Amend** message to determine what has changed from the original **Collateral Pledge** message.
  * _Edit_ any movements which are changed in the **Pledge Amend** message.
  * _Add_ any movements that are _included_ in the **Pledge Amend** message, but were not in the original **Collateral Pledge** message.
  * Conversely, _delete_ any movements which were included in the original Pledge message, but are _omitted_ in the **Pledge Amend** message.



Assuming no validation errors occur, the Demand and its revised collateral movements are transitioned to the **Confirmed to be Approved** state.

## Pledge Cancel

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to **Pledge Cancel** a Demand, the system does the following:

  1. Movements that are in a rejected status in the **Demand Workflow - Agreed Awaiting Collateral Details** state will be set to a status of ignored.
  2. The Demand can then be re-processed in that state via **Pledge Amend** messages.



## Pledge Accept

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to **Pledge Accept** on an Anticipated Demand, the system does the following:

  1. If the Counterparty sends a Pledge Accept message, the Margin Call and its attached Collateral Movements are transitioned to **Antic Demands - Confirmed sent to Settlements** state. The movements are updated to a status of In Transit. This completes the margin call processing cycle for the Anticipated Demand in Acadia.



## Pledge Reject

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to **Pledge Reject** on an Anticipated Demand, the system does the following:

  1. If the Counterparty sends a Pledge Reject message, the Margin Call and its attached Collateral Movements are transitioned to **Antic Demands - Agreed Awaiting Collateral Details** state. The movements are updated to a status of Rejected, and a message is sent to the Counterparty via Acadia cancelling the movements. The movements are cancelled so that any changes that are made by the user in the _Agreed-Awaiting Collateral Details_ state and then approved will send the movements as new movements to the Counterparty via Acadia.



## Initial Margin Exposure Details

When the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Adapter receives a message from Acadia to initiate an **Anticipated Demand** margin call, the system does the following:

  1. TLM Collateral Management will [match](<messaging_margincalls.html#margin-call-matching-criteria>) the margin call and automatically [process](<messaging_anticdemand_workflow.html#anticipated-demands-state>) the message accordingly.
  2. The Initial Margin Exposure details cannot be processed within TLM Collateral Management. These details will be published as an exception to the TLM Collateral Management Messaging Intervention Tool.
