By default, when a user is created, the user id is set to an Activated status.

To de-active a user, click the **Deactivate** button. To reactive at user, click the **Active** button.

This can be done for security or compliance reasons, such as when a user leaves the organization, or is absent for an extended period.

User Id's in a deactivated state can be activated.

The Users screen alphabetically lists user id's that exist in the authorization database, together with the activation action that can be applied.

That is, User ID's that are in an active state, can be deactivated and User ID's in a deactivated state can be activated.

To _deactivate_ a user, click on the **Deactivate** button to the right of the User Id.

To activate a user, click on the **Activate** button to the right of the User Id.

**Note:** When a user is deactivated, please keep in mind the following:

  * The user cannot be selected for assignment to Agreement Responsibility or Agreement Groups within the core TLM Collateral application.
  * The Is Active flag in the Users screen in the core TLM Collateral application is cleared.
