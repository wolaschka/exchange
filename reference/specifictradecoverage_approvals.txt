# Approvals Process for Specific Trade Coverage

When new records are added to the Specific Trade Coverage for an Agreement, either for trades to be included or excluded, each record is locked as soon as it is added to the grid by clicking the **Save** button.

The warning icon appears under the Actions column for each item and those records are now Pending Approval. These locked records cannot be deleted. Note however, that the Agreement itself is not locked as part of this process. When the user hovers over the warning icon, it will say "Locked for changes".

Each record is displayed as a separate "Insert" row in the Approvals screen under the Pending Approval Type and must be approved or rejected individually.

Once a record has been approved or rejected, its corresponding row in the Agreement Specific Trade Coverage grid is no longer locked and is free to be deleted.

If a record is deleted from the Agreement Margins grid, this also becomes locked and is identified by a warning icon that will state "Locked for changes" when hovered over the icon.

Each record is displayed as a separate "Delete" row under the Pending Approval type. Again, the records must be approved or rejected individually.
