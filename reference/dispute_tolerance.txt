# Dispute Tolerances

## Defining Dispute Tolerances

Dispute Tolerances are used to prevent minor differences between margin call amounts and agreed amounts being recorded as partial disputes.

Dispute Tolerances can be set as either a percentage of the margin call or as a fixed absolute amount.

| Examples  
---|---  
Percentage of Call Amount Dispute Tolerance Consider a 5% dispute tolerance | A Margin call of USD 1,000,000 is calculated and sent to a Counterparty.  
The Counterparty agrees USD 900,000, which is input as an agreed amount.  
The original demand margin call item with USD 900,000 agreed is advanced to the next stage of the Workflow.  
A partial dispute of USD 100,000 is created and placed in the disputes queue, because the difference between the agreed amount and call amount is 10% of the call amount.  
If the Counterparty agreed USD 960,000 - no dispute would be recorded as the USD 40,000 difference between the agreed amount and call amount is 4%.  
The difference between the call amount and the agreed amount needs to be 5% or greater to create a partial dispute item in this scenario.  
Fixed Amount Dispute Tolerance | Consider a USD 10,000 fixed amount Dispute Tolerance.  
A Margin call of USD 1,000,000 is calculated and sent to a Counterparty.  
The Counterparty agrees USD 980,000. USD 980,000 is input as an agreed amount.  
The original demand margin call with USD 980,000 agreed amount recorded is advanced in the Workflow.  
A partial dispute of USD 20,000 is created as the absolute difference between the agreed amount and the call amount is greater than USD 10,000.  
The partial dispute of USD 20,000 is advanced to the disputes Workflow.  
If the Counterparty agrees to USD 990,001 or more, than no partial dispute will be created, as the absolute difference between agreed amount and call amount is less than USD 10,000.  
The difference between the call amount and the agreed amount must be less than USD 10,000 for no dispute item to be created.  
  
  
Dispute Tolerances can be defined at two levels in the system:

  * At an [organization type level](<reference_related_data.html#organization-type>).

  * At an [individual agreement level](<agreement_actions.html#create-agreements>), dispute tolerances that are defined at agreement level take precedence over dispute tolerances defined at Organization level.
