# Demand Workflow - Confirmed State

## Overview

Demands are moved into this Workflow state once they have been approved in the Demand Workflow - Confirmed Workflow state, or if approvals have been disabled, they are advanced directly from Demand Workflow - Agreed.

Irrespective of their transition origin, Demands remain in this Workflow state until they are fully completed.

Once an Demand has been transitioned into this state, the agreed amount entered in the Demand Workflow - Sent state is no longer taken into consideration in any subsequent Margin Calculations.

Instead, the current market value of the collateral movements that were entered are taken into consideration as in Transit collateral. The value of the collateral movements is calculated as follows:
    
    
    Price of Instrument * Notional * Valuation Percentage * FX conversion rate (if applicable)
    

Collateral Held or Posted balances are also taken into consideration in margin calculations.

## Completion process

A Demand is only fully completed when all the collateral movements have been updated to a settled or cancelled. This is done by the Settle Movements task.

Once all the collateral movements for a particular Demand Margin Call have been marked as such, then the item will be removed from this state.

One exception to the completion process exists, and is applicable to these form.

As these form of agreements generate a margin call for the Lock Up requirement of the margin call and a separate margin call for the Variation element of the margin call, there are at least two margin call requirements per single call.

As these separate margin call requirements are processed separately through the workflows, each of the individual margin call requirements can reach a settled state independently.

This means, that although an individual call requirement is completed, the whole margin call may not be, until each margin call requirement reaches its final state.

**Note:** Items in this state are filtered according to the Agreement Scope and Agreement Responsibility Groups that the user is assigned to. See [Understanding Agreement Scopes and Agreement Responsibility Groups](<understand_scope_responsibility.html>).
