## Search Criteria

Buckets can be viewed by selecting buckets from the navigation pane.

There are two ways to return bucket data.

  1. To return all buckets by clicking on the **Search** button.

  2. To return a subset of buckets based on a name within the search field labeled **Bucket Name** ; enter all or part of the bucket name. The field is case insensitive and an asterisk can be used as a wild card. Click the **Search** button to return the data.




To clear the search criteria, click the **Clear Filters** button.

## Grid Features

The bucket grid can be [sorted](<grid_features.md#sorting>), [paged](<grid_features.md#paging>), [exported](<grid_features.md#export-grid>), [reorder columns](<grid_features.md#reorder-columns>), and fields can be [disabled or resized](<grid_features.md#display-and-resizing-columns>).

## Buckets Grid View

The fields displayed in the grid are listed below in the default display order:

Field | Description  
---|---  
Name | This is the name of the bucket and will be selected in agreements and referenced throughout the system.  
Instrument Class | This field will be one of the following classes:  
  
Debt  
Cash  
Equity  
Letter of Credit.  
  
This field is determined based on how the group was defined.  
  
## Create Buckets

**Procedure**

  1. Select the ![create_bucket_button.jpg](Images/create_bucket_button.jpg) button.
  2. Select the type for the bucket to be created.

The current choices are:

     * [Cash](<buckets_cash.md>)
     * [Equity](<buckets_equity.md>)
     * [Letters of Credit](<buckets_loc.md>)



The choice of buckets determines which default bucket screen opens. All required fields must be filled in before the **Save** button becomes enabled. The required fields are noted by the red star next to the label.
