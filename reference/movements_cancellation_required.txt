# Configuring Approval to be Required on Cancellations

It is possible to configure TLM® Collateral Management to treat Collateral Movements that are:

  * Cancelled via the Movements Screen 



in two ways. 

Essentially the application can be configured at a system level to either require or not require that Movement Cancellations require approval.

The configuration is made outside of the application - so please speak to your system administrator for more information, but for reference, it is defined in the following system level configuration key:
    
    
    <add key="IsMovementCancellationApprovalRequired" value="True"
    

If the key is set with a value of True, the action will require approval when a [Cancel a Movement](<movements.html#cancel-a-manual-movement>) is done via the Movements Screen.

Conversely, when set to False, approval is not required.

The following sections provide more details as to the behavior in each case

**IsMovementCancellationApprovalRequired Set as True**

When a cancel action is applied to a movement, the movement remains in its existing settlement state [either In Transit, Failed, or Settled], but a Pending Cancellation Flag is set on the movement.

Additionally the movement is "locked". The movement is then is subject to the approval / rejection process. If the Pending Cancellation is approved, then the movement is updated to a cancelled status.

If rejected, it remains in its existing settlement state.

**Note:** Movements that have a Pending Cancellation flag set, are taken into consideration in Margin Calculations.

**IsMovementCancellationApprovalRequired Set as False**

When a cancel action is applied to a movement, the movement is updated to a cancelled state without requiring further approval.

**Note:** Movements in a Cancelled Settlement state, are not taken into consideration in Margin Calculations.
