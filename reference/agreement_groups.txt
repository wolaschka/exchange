# Central Clearing Agreement Group

Central Clearing Agreement groups provide a mechanism for grouping together Margin Calls in the Central Clearing Workflow. It is also possible to filter Margin Calls displayed in the Central Clearing workflow by Central Clearing Agreement group.

Consider the following:

  * An Agreement must be associated to a Central Clearing Agreement group so that any margin calls associated are viewable and actionable in the central clearing Workflow.
  * If an Agreement is not associated to a central clearing Agreement group it can be seen in the ALL tab, but not actioned.
  * Users can only see margin calls in the Central Clearing Workflow for Agreements that are members of a Central Clearing Agreement group that the user is associated to.



**Procedure:**

Select **Reference** from the navigation pane. 

Click on the **Agreements** drop down and select **Agreement Groups**.

**To Add a new group:**  
* Click on the **Create Combined Business Lines** button located on the top right side of the screen.

**To Edit a group:**  
* Click on the **Edit** icon next to the group that needs to be modified, make the changes and click the **Save** button to save the changes.

A form will open up and contain 2 tabs. The required fields must have data before the **Save** button will appear.

**Note:** Fields in red are required.

**Note:** Agreements that meet any of the following filtering criteria will be excluded from the search results:  
  
\- Agreements not covered by the user's Agreement Scope. Or in other words, any Agreement with a Parent Entity that is not included in the Agreement scope that the user is associated to.  
  
\- Agreements for non-Central Clearing Business Lines.  
  
\- Central Clearing Agreements that are already included on another Central Clearing Agreement Group. A Central Agreement can only be included on a single Central Clearing Agreement Group  
User Assignments | Users | Users | Users must be assigned to a Central Clearing Agreement Group before they can select it as a filter in the Grouped Interest and Grouped Margin Call Workflows. If users are not assigned to any Central Clearing Agreement Groups they will not see any items in the Grouped Workflows.  
  
## Combined Business Line Agreement Group

**Combined Business Line** Agreement Groups are used to group together Collateral Agreements so that bulk processing of 

  * Margin Calls

  * Interest Payments




for Agreements within the OTC and Client Clearing Business line can be facilitated within TLM® Collateral Management.

**Example:**

A Fund Manager may be responsible for managing the collateral requirements across a number of Funds (typically a separate Collateral Agreement would be in place for each Fund), and wishes to bulk process Margin Calls and Interest Payments.

Agreement Groups provide a mechanism of grouping together these "Funds" for bulk processing.

**Note:** Only OTC Agreements and Client Clearing Agreements can be added to a Combined Business Line Agreement Group.

**Procedure:**

Select **Reference** from the navigation pane. 

Click on the **Agreements** drop down and select **Agreement Groups**.

Click on the **Create Combined Business Lines**.

A form will open up and contain 5 tabs. Two of the tabs will require fields data before the **Save** button will appear.

**Note:** Fields in red are required.

**Note:**

  1. Agreements can only be added to or removed from a Combined Business Lines Agreement Group when there are no "actioned" Margin Calls or "Interest Payments" See [Moving Agreements in and out Combined Business Lines Agreement Group](<move_agmt_inout_combined_busline.html>) for more details.
  2. Client Clearing Agreements can only be subject to the Grouped Margin Calculation Configuration and Tasks when they are associated to a Combined Business Lines Agreement Group. Failure to do so will mean margin calls are not calculated and created for these Agreements. 
  3. Combined Business Line Agreement Groups are audited in the standard way.
  4. After creating a Combined Business Lines Agreement Group or altering its composition, it is recommended to log off and then back into the system to avoid any caching delays and ensure that any membership updates are fully reflected in all system areas.
