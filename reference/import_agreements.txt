# File Format for Agreements

When importing Agreements all previous records are not deleted when a new import is run. The import is done on an insert and update basis.

When the import is run, the system checks to see whether the agreement already exists. This check is done using the [Source Reference](<#sourcereference>) and the Agreement Name as follows:

  1. If a Source Reference is supplied and matches an existing source reference in TLM® Collateral Management, then the import updates the agreement (subject to other validation criteria). If the Agreement Name supplied for the source reference is different to the name stored in TLM Collateral Management, the name in will be updated, as long as there is not already an agreement existing with that name. If there is an existing agreement with the same name the record will not be updated and an exception will be generated. [Validation message number 119](<validation_messages.html#119>). 
  2. If the Source Reference supplied does not match an existing source reference in TLM Collateral Management then the import will add a new agreement, as long as the agreement name does not already exist. If there is an existing agreement with the same name the record will not be updated and an exception will be generated. [Validation message number 121](<validation_messages.html#121>).
  3. If the Source Reference is not supplied or this column has not been mapped, then the update or insert will be done simply based on the Agreement Name. If the name already exists in TLM Collateral Management, the agreement will be updated with the record on the file. If the name does not exist then the agreement will be inserted.



While the import of Agreements in done on an insert and update basis, the import of certain fields within the Agreement data object is done on a replacement basis. Those fields are:

Holiday Calendars - this is detailed in the description columns for those fields in the below table. Exact Dates for Interest Period End.

**Note:**

  1. The Fields on the import are described below. As there are numerous permutations as to how Interest Period End Dates and Frequencies can be defined, some examples of the mapping files and import data are shown in [Example Import of Agreement Interest Payment Terms](<example_agmt_int_payment_terms.html>) as an aid.
  2. It is only possible to import agreements that are for the OTC (except OTC Lock Up Only - see item 3), Repo and Securities Lending Business Lines. This is determined via Agreement Type Field.
  3. It is not possible to import OTC Lock Up Only agreements using this configuration. There is a separate [import configuration](<import_agreement_lock_up_only.html>) to process Lock Up Only agreements.
  4. Margin Valuation Frequency can be included on Agreement imports from TLM Collateral version 5.8 onwards. The Fields on the import are described below. As there are numerous permutations as to how Frequencies can be defined, some examples of the mapping file and import data are shown in examples of import [Agreement Margin Valuation Frequency](<example_import_agmt_margin_val_freq.html>).

Agreements Display Name | Mapping File Column Name | Mandatory | Type, Length and comments | Example | Description  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Agreement Ccy | AgreementCurrency | Yes | Char (3) | USD | The agreement currency which must correspond to a currency in the database.

Agreement names cannot be the same as an existing agreement alias.  
  
[Validation message number 141](<validation_messages.html#141>)  
  
**Note:** If the Agreement is [Locked for Approval](<agreements_approvals.html>), [validation message 263](<validation_messages.html#263>) will be raised, and the record for the corresponding agreement will **not be imported**.  
Status | AgreementStatus | Yes | Char(100) | Active  
  
Inactive  
  
Monitor | Determines whether the Agreement will be subject to the Margin Calculation Task, and whether the margin calculation will be fully applied.  
  
**Active** \- All Margin Calls will be generated.  
  
**Inactive** \- Agreement will not be included in Margin calculation tasks.  
  
**Monitor** \- Agreement will be included in Margin Calculation task but only No Action Margin Calls will be generated irrespective of margin parameters.  
  
The value on the data file must match a value defined in the database, otherwise [validation message 237](<validation_messages.html#237>) is raised and the **record is not imported**.  
Status Detail | AgreementStatusDetail | No | Char(100) | Not signed. | Supplementary information regarding the status of the Agreement.  
  
The field is not mandatory but if mapped the value supplied must match a record in [Agreement Status Detail reference](<reference.html>) data otherwise [Validation Message 235](<validation_messages.html#235>) will be raised, and a Null Value used.  
Type | AgreementType | Yes | Char (100) | ISDA | This is the collateral agreement type and must exist in the database.  
  
[Validation message number 64](<validation_messages.html#64>)  
  
When the record is an update the  
  
Agreement Type cannot currently be changed as this has significant impacts on other data used in the agreement.  
  
[Validation Message 104](<validation_messages.html#104>)  
  
For an insert, any trade types associated with the Agreement Type are automatically set to be on the "Included" side of the [Trade Types select](<agreements_tradecoverage.html>) dialog for the relevant agreement.  
  
Additionally, if the [Agreement type](<reference_related_data.html#agreement-types>) defined is for a Business Line of Central Clearing or Client Clearing, [validation message 302](<validation_messages.html#302>) is raised, and the record is not loaded.  
Intraday Calcs | AllowIntradayCalculation | No | Bit | Acceptable values:  
  
Y, N, Yes, No | Defines whether an agreement will generate intraday margin calls when subsequent margin calculations are run during the course of a business day.  
  
See [Intraday Margin Calculations](<intraday_mc.html>)  
  
**Note:**  
  
1\. The field can only be set for OTC Agreements, otherwise [validation message 333](<validation_messages.html#333>) raised.  
  
2\. Once this field is set as True either via the GUI or by an import, it cannot be subsequently changed back to False by an import. This can only be achieved via the application's GUI. If an attempt to change an existing value to false via the import [valuation message 334](<validation_messages.html#334>) is raised.  
Amendment Date | AmendmentDate | No | Date | 13-Sep-2009 | The date an amendment was made to the collateral agreement.  
  
Value if mapped must be in a recognizable date format otherwise [validation message 10](<validation_messages.html#10>) will be raises and a Null value will be used.  
Available for Rehypothecation | AvailableForRehypothecation | Yes | Char (50) | Must be defined as one of the following:  
  
None  
  
Variation Only  
  
Lock Up Only (see notes)  
  
Both Lock Up And Variation | This value indicates whether the collateral that is **received from** the Counterparty on the Agreement can be rehypothecated.  
  
Additionally if defined as anything other than "None", the value denotes the **margin type** of collateral that can be rehypothecated.  
  
If the value is **missing** , then  
  
[validation message 9](<validation_messages.html#9>) will be raised, **and the whole record will not be loaded**.  
  
If the value is invalid, then [validation message 242](<validation_messages.html#242>) will be raised **and the whole record will not be loaded.**  
  
If the value is specified as **_Lock Up Only_** an additional validation takes place: If **_CollateralAllocationType_** is not defined as **_Segregate Lock Up And Variation_** , then [validation message 243](<validation_messages.html#243>) will be raised **and the whole record will not be loaded**.  
Calculation Type | CalculationType | No | Char (25) | Isda Unsecured | The Calculation Type will determine the type of margin calculation which will be run for the agreement. The type must correspond to one available for the relevant Business Line as follows:  
  
**OTC**  
  
ISDA Unsecured  
  
ISDA Security  
  
**Repo/Securities Lending**  
  
Repo Net  
  
Repo Standard  
  
[Validation message number 138](<validation_messages.html#138>).  
Default Settlement Offset: Cash | CashSettlementOffset | No | Char(255) | T  
  
T+1  
  
T+2  
  
T+3 | Number of business days offset that will be used to calculate settlement date for collateral movements for Debt Instruments for this Agreement.  
  
Permissible values are T, T+1, T+2, T+3.  
  
Although not compulsory, if not included in the file, or the value is invalid, [validation message 251](<validation_messages.html#251>) will be raised, and the system default value will be applied (value per the web.config file) If no system default is defined, the value will be defaulted to T.  
Collat Allocation | CollateralAllocationType | Yes | Char (50) | Auto Allocate  
  
Segregate Lock Up And Variation | This field is mandatory and denotes how collateral is to be allocated.  
  
It must be defined as one of the two values listed to the left.  
  
The very first validation on this import is to determine if a **Lock Up Only** Agreement is tried to be imported using this import configuration. If so, a [validation message 343](<validation_messages.html#343>) is raised and the entire record is not accepted.  
  
If an existing **Lock Up Only** agreement is tried to be changed to an OTC agreement via this import, a [validation message 351](<validation_messages.html#351>) is raised and the entire record is not accepted.  
  
**Otherwise** :  
  
If defined as **Auto Allocate** , collateral will be "auto allocated". This means the system will automatically allocate any collateral toward the lock up requirement first. Once the lock up requirement is met, any remaining collateral will be allocated toward the variation requirement.  
  
If defined as **Segregate Lock Up and Variation** , the system does not perform any such allocations, and collateral must be explicitly defined as being either for Lock Up margin type or variation margin type.  
  
Additionally, any surplus collateral held for either the lock up requirement is not applied to any deficit in the variation requirement, and vice-versa.  
  
If the field is missing, [validation message 9](<validation_messages.html#9>)  
  
is raised, **and the record is not imported**.  
  
If the field does not contain a permissible value, [validation message 240](<validation_messages.html#240>) is raised, **and the record is not imported**.  
  
An additional validation is performed on this field if it is set to Segregate Lock Up and Variation.  
  
If so, then LockUpCalculationType value must be defined as "Not Netted Against Variation" otherwise [validation message 241](<validation_messages.html#241>) will be raised and the record will not be imported.  
  
Please see  
  
[Changing Collateral Allocation Type on an OTC Agreement](<agreement_change_collatallocation.html>) for more information.  
Price Quote | CollateralValuationQuote | Yes | Char (50) | Bid | The Price Quote Type that the agreement will use.  
  
Price Quote Type must be on the mapping file, otherwise the agreement file load will fail with:  
  
[Validation Message 36](<validation_messages.html#36>)  
  
The value must correspond to one of the values in the system:  
  
Bid  
  
Mid  
  
Ask  
  
If the quote type on the file doesn't match any of the above three values,   
  
[Validation Message 9](<validation_messages.html#9>) can be seen  
  
and  
  
[Validation Message 191](<validation_messages.html#191>)  
  
and the existing quote type for the agreement will remain in the system.  
  
If the value is not supplied on the file,   
  
[Validation Message 9](<validation_messages.html#9>)  
  
will be seen and the existing quote type for the agreement will remain in the system.  
  
**Note:** This value cannot be amended to Auto Allocate for existing agreements that exist with value of Segregate Lock Up and Variation. If this is attempted, [validation message 249](<validation_messages.html#249>) will be raised, and the whole import record for this agreement will be ignored.  
Price Source | CollateralPriceSource | No | Char (100) | Bloomberg | This is the price source for collateral positions on the agreement.  
  
**Note:** If value is not supplied, then the agreement will be set to use the system default value even if a specific value existed for the agreement before the import.  
  
Similarly, if a value is supplied on the file for price source that doesn't exist in the system, [Validation Message 196](<validation_messages.html#196>) can be seen and the price source for the agreement will be set to use system default, even if it was previously set to a defined price source.  
Counterparty | Counterparty | Yes | Char (250) | ABC Bank Ltd | This is the counterparty with which the collateral agreement has been signed and must exist in the database.  
  
[Validation message number 21](<validation_messages.html#21>)

T+2  
  
T+3 | Number of business days offset that will be used to calculate settlement date for collateral movements for Debt Instruments for this Agreement.  
  
Permissible values are T, T+1, T+2, T+3.  
  
Although not compulsory, if not included in the file, or the value is invalid, [validation message 251](<validation_messages.html#251>) will be raised, and the system default value will be applied (value per the web.config file) If no system default is defined, the value will be defaulted to T+1.  
Exclude trades ending on or before | ExcludesTradeDays | No | Char (255) | T+2 | The Trades Filter option for Repo agreements to determine the basis on which trades should be excluded from the Exposure Calculation based on their end date. The allowed choices are:

T+2  
  
T+3  
  
[Validation message number 124](<validation_messages.html#124>)  
  
For agreements which do not use this functionality the field should be left blank.  
Extension Label Name | < ExtensionName >  
  
**Note:** If values are to be loaded into extensions, then the mapping file must include the ExtensionName exactly as it has been defined in the Agreement Extension Reference Data Object.  
  
Additionally, the mapping file must explicitly define that the field is an extension.  
  
See [Example of Agreement Mapping File with Extensions](<import_example_agmt_mapping_file.html>) for example of this. | No | Extension Values can only be one of the following 4 data types.  
  
**AlphaNumeric**  
  
**Numeric**  
  
**Date**  
  
**Boolean**  
  
Y, Yes, 1, True, T  
  
F, No, 0, False, F  
  
**List** |  | Extension Values can be loaded on the Agreement Import file.  
  
Although extensions are not mandatory, there are some specific rules:  
  
1\. The ExtensionName specified in the Import File must be identical to the Extension Name on the Agreement Extension Reference Data object.  
  
Additionally, the mapping file must state that the field is an Extension.  
  
(See [Example of Agreement Mapping File](<import_example_agmt_mapping_file.html>) with Extensions for examples)  
  
If not, then the validation message 8 will be raised, and the file will not load.  
  
2\. If the Extension is defined as a **Numeric Data Type** , any values on the import file for this extension must also be numeric, otherwise [validation message 11](<validation_messages.html#11>) will be raised, and the value will be set to NULL.  
  
3\. If the Extension is defined as an **AlphaNumeric Data Type** and the length of the value on the Import file does not fall within the lower and upper limits, then [validation message 232](<validation_messages.html#232>) will be raised, and the value will be not be loaded.  
  
4\. If the Extension is defined as **Numeric** , the values on the import file must be within the minimum and maximum numbers as defined on the reference data object. If not, then [validation message 233](<validation_messages.html#233>) will be raised and the value will not be loaded.  
  
5\. If the Extension field is defined as a **Boolean** , the values on the import file must be one of the following (**Yes, Y, 1, True, T, No, N, 0, False, F**) otherwise [validation message 19](<validation_messages.html#19>) will be raised, and the value will not be loaded.  
  
6\. If the extension field is defined as a **Date** , then the values on the import file must be in a recognized date format, otherwise [validation message 10](<validation_messages.html#10>) is raised, and the value ignored.  
  
7\. If the extension field is defined as a **List** , then the values on the import must match the defined values in the system. Otherwise [validation message 365](<validation_messages.html#365>) is raised and the value is set to Null.  
  
**Note:** When importing extension values, **all** existing extension values stored for the agreement are deleted, and then replaced with those (successfully validated) values specified on the import file. Care should therefore be undertaken to ensure that the import file contains values for all extensions.  
Governing Law | Governing Law | No | Char (100) | FRANCE | The Governing Law of the Agreement. If mapped, the value on the data file must match an existing country value in the database, otherwise [Validation Message 236](<validation_messages.html#236>) is raised and a Null value is applied.  
Calendars | HolidayCalendar | No | Char (2000) | UK Holidays | This is the name of the Holiday Calendar reference data item that will be associated to the agreement.  
  
If the name of the Holiday Calendar contained in the import file is not found in the system [Validation Message 205](<validation_messages.html#205>) is raised.  
  
If more than one Holiday Calendar on an agreement is being imported, use a [sub delimiter in the mapping file](<import_using_sub_delimiter.html>).  
  
**Note:** If numerous Holiday Calendar entries are being imported for an agreement using a sub-delimiter, and one or more of the entries on the file does not exist as reference data item within the system, [Validation Message 205](<validation_messages.html#205>) will be seen and none of the Holiday Calendar entries for that agreement will be imported.  
  
If the HolidayCalendar is included in the mapping file, then any Holiday Calendar entries that exist on an agreement will be replaced in entirety by the entries contained on the Agreements Import File.  
  
If there are no entries on the import file, or there are numerous entries sub-delimited on the import file; one or more of which doesn't exist in the database; then the existing Holiday calendar entries for the agreement in the system will be erased.  
Apply Decimals and Rounding To | InterestApplyPrecisionTo | Yes | Char (255) | Acceptable Values  
  
Daily Accruals  
  
Final Payment Only | This value must be defined as one of the acceptable values. If not, then [validation message 9](<validation_messages.html#9>) and [validation message 268](<validation_messages.html#268>) will be raised.  
  
If not, the record will not be loaded.  
Include Lock Up Accrual in Margin Calc | IncludeLockUpAccrual | Yes | Bit | Acceptable values:  
  
Y, N, Yes, No | Denotes whether interest accruals on cash positions for margin type lock up should be included in margin calculations.  
  
The field is mandatory - if blank on the data file it will be interpreted as Null and therefore will set the field to No.  
  
If the value on the import file is not one of the acceptable values, [valuation message 19](<validation_messages.html#19>) will be raised, and the value will be interpreted as Null and therefore will set the field to No.  
Include Variation Accrual in Margin Calc | IncludeVariationAccrual | Yes | Bit | Acceptable values:  
  
Y, N, Yes, No | Denotes whether interest accruals on cash positions for margin type variation should be included in margin calculations.  
  
The field is mandatory - if blank on the data file it will be interpreted as Null and therefore set the field to No  
  
If the value on the import file is not one of the acceptable values, [valuation message 19](<validation_messages.html#19>) will be raised, and the value will be interpreted as Null and therefore set the field to No.  
Distribution Preference | InterestPaymentPreference | Yes | Char (25) | Distribute  
  
Roll In | If a value other than Distribute or Roll In is supplied, the system will raise [validation message 219](<validation_messages.html#219>), and will default the value to Distribute - **even if a value already exists for the field**.  
Payment Period Holiday Calendar | InterestPaymentCalendar | No | Char (100) | UK Holiday | If the value supplied on the file does not match a Holiday Calendar defined in the system, [validation message 205](<validation_messages.html#205>) will be raised and the field will be blanked, irrespective of whether any values existed.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency | InterestPaymentFrequency | No - but see notes | Char (25) | Acceptable Values  
  
\- Exact  
  
\- Weekly  
  
\- Monthly  
  
Considerations for this field:  
  
\- If value = Exact, InterestPeriodExactDates needs to be populated.  
  
\- If Value = Weekly, InterestPaymentDayOfWeek  
  
needs to be populated.  
  
\- If Value = Monthly  
  
\- InterestPaymentCalendarType  
  
and  
  
\- InterestPaymentMonths  
  
need to be populated.  
  
Additionally, depending on InterestPaymentCalendarType  
  
definition, either  
  
InterestPaymentDayOfMonth  
  
or  
  
InterestPaymentWeekOfMonth  
  
need to be populated. | If this field is not supplied, the system will do the following:- If an entry for this already exists for the agreement, the system will disregard the value on the file.  
  
\- If the import is inserting a new agreement - the system will set the value for the agreement to be Monthly, with last calendar day of month as payment end date.  
  
In either case, the value of any of  
  
\- InterestPaymentExactDates  
\- InterestPaymentDayOfWeek  
\- InterestPaymentDayOfMonth  
\- InterestPaymentCalendarType  
\- InterestPaymentMonths  
\- InterestPaymentWeekOfMonth  
  
on the file will be ignored.  
  
If the value supplied is invalid, and the import is inserting a new agreement, the agreement will be created with default payment timing and no message will be raised.  
  
If the value supplied is invalid, and the import is updating an existing agreement, [validation message 221](<validation_messages.html#221>) will be raised, and the values on the import will be ignored.  
  
It is therefore recommended that the field be populated.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency - exact dates - selected dates | InterestPaymentExactDates | No - but see notes | Char (1000) | 27/10/2008 | When InterestPeriodFrequency is defined as Exact, record in this field the exact dates for the payments, using the date format specified in the agreement config.  
  
Numerous dates can be specified using a sub-delimeter.  
  
**Note:** If an invalid date is specified, the system will raise [validation message 223](<validation_messages.html#223>), and the system will default interest Payment period to be Monthly, last calendar day of the month, unless exact dates already exist in the database.  
  
If duplicate dates are supplied for this field for the same agreement, [validation message 224](<validation_messages.html#224>) is raised, and one of the duplicates is loaded.  
  
**Note:** If values are supplied for this field, then any existing exact dates in the system will be replaced with those specified in the import file.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency - weekly selection | InterestPaymentDayOfWeek | No - but see notes | Char (25) | Monday  
  
Tuesday  
  
Wednesday  
  
Thursday  
  
Friday  
  
Saturday  
  
Sunday | Although not mandatory, this field needs to be populated when InterestPeriodFrequency  
  
is defined as Weekly  
  
or Monthly and InterestPaymentCalendarType = Relative Day.  
  
If this value is not supplied then the system will raise  
  
[validation message 222](<validation_messages.html#222>).  
  
**_(NB - this warning is currently not working on weekly timings)_**  
  
If the import is creating an agreement (insert) then if missing the system will default the interest Payment frequency to be last calendar day of month.  
  
If the import is amending an existing agreement (update), and this field is blank, then the existing day of week in database will be unchanged.  
  
If an invalid day of week is included in the import file, [validation message 220](<validation_messages.html#220>) is raised. If an existing day of the week exists for the agreement in the system this will be untouched.  
  
However if the import is inserting a new agreement, an incorrect day of week being specified will result in Interest Payment Frequency of last calendar day of month being inserted.  
  
**Note:** Although importable values are [Monday --> Sunday], only values of Monday --> Friday are selectable via the GUI for Monthly Relative Day frequencies.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency - monthly selection | InterestPaymentDayOfMonth | No - but see notes | Char (25) | 1st, 2nd, 3rd.....Last  
  
If InterestPaymentCalendarType  
  
= Calendar Day values can be  
  
1st, 2nd.....31st or Last  
  
InterestPaymentCalendarType  
  
= Business Day values can be  
  
1st, 2nd.....23rd or Last | When Interest Period Frequency is defined as Monthly, and InterestPaymentCalendarType is defined as either CalendarDay or BusinessDay, this field needs to be populated.  
  
If an incorrect value is specified - e.g. 12st or no value is included , then [validation message 227](<validation_messages.html#227>) is raised and newly inserted agreements will be created with last calendar day of every month as default Interest Payment Frequency.  
  
If the import is amending a record, and the value is incorrect then the existing record will be untouched, but the same validation message will be raised.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency - monthly selection | InterestPaymentCalendarType | No - but see notes | Char (25) | Calendar Day  
  
Business Day  
  
Relative Day | When Interest Period Frequency is defined as Monthly this field needs to be populated.  
  
If it is incorrectly populated newly inserted agreements will be created with last calendar day of every month as default Interest Payment Frequency, and no validation message will be raised.  
  
If an agreement exists with this value already populated, incorrect values will raise [validation message 227](<validation_messages.html#227>) but the existing values will be unchanged.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency - monthly selection | InterestPaymentMonths | No - but see notes | Char (500) | January  
  
February...December  
  
Alternatively - ALL will populate all months. | When Interest Period Frequency is defined as Monthly this field needs to be populated.  
  
Specific Months can be defined by specifying a sub delimiter in the config file.  
  
Alternatively, including ALL as the value for this will populate all months.  
  
If no month is specified, or an invalid month is specified, [validation message 227](<validation_messages.html#227>) will be raised, and newly inserted agreements will be defaulted to be Interest Payment frequency of Monthly last calendar day.  
  
If an agreement exists, and the value is either missing or invalid - [validation message 227](<validation_messages.html#227>) is raised, but existing payment frequencies are not touched.  
Payment Period Ending Frequency - monthly selection | InterestPaymentWeekOfMonth | No - but see notes | Char (25) | First  
  
Second  
  
Third  
  
Fourth  
  
Last | When InterestPeriodFrequency is defined as Monthly and InterestPaymentCalendarType is defined as Relative Day this field needs to be populated to define which week within the month that the Interest Payment will be made.  
  
If the value is omitted or an incorrect value is supplied  
  
[validation message 227](<validation_messages.html#227>) will be raised, and newly inserted agreements will be defaulted to be Interest Payment frequency of Monthly last calendar day.  
  
If an agreement exists, and the value is either missing or invalid - [validation message 227](<validation_messages.html#227>) is raised, but existing payment frequencies are not touched.

The very first validation on this import is to determine if a **Lock Up Only** Agreement is tried to be imported using this import configuration. If so, a [validation message 343](<validation_messages.html#343>) is raised and the entire record is not accepted.  
  
If an existing **Lock Up Only** agreement is tried to be changed to an OTC agreement via this import, a [validation message 351](<validation_messages.html#351>) is raised and the entire record is not accepted.  
  
If no value is provided (or an invalid value is provided) the default value " NotNetted against variation" will be used.  
  
A validation warning will be provided when an invalid value is supplied.

Split Amount | SplitToleranceAmount | No - but see notes | Decimal (21,6) | 1000 | The Split the Difference Tolerance Amount  
  
Should the difference between the Principal Call Amount and the Counterparty Call Amount fall within the Split the Difference Tolerance Amount, then the system will incorporate half of the difference when calculating the Agreed amount in the Margin Call Workflows.  
  
The numeric value defined here is interpreted in conjunction with Split Tolerance Method value.  
  
When SplitToleranceMethod is defined as Flat, then amount should be defined and must be a positive numeric value. If not, a validation message [360](<validation_messages.html#360>), [363](<validation_messages.html#363>) or [11](<validation_messages.html#11>) will be raised.  
  
When SplitToleranceMethod defined as Percent of Call Amount,then amount should be defined and must be a positive numeric value within a valid percentage range of 1 - 100. If not, a validation message [360](<validation_messages.html#360>), [361](<validation_messages.html#361>), [362](<validation_messages.html#362>) or [11](<validation_messages.html#11>) will be raised. Six Decimal places of precision are supported.  
Split Currency | SplitToleranceCurrency | No - but see notes | Char (3) | USD | The Currency associated to SplitToleranceMethod  
  
When Split Method is defined as Flat, then a currency should be specified for the tolerance amount and must be a define currency in the system. If not, [validation message 363](<validation_messages.html#363>) or [357](<validation_messages.html#357>) will be raised.

Pct. of Call Amount | The Method associated with the SplitToleranceMethod  
  
When either the Amount or Currency is defined on the import, the Method also has to be specified. If not, the [validation message 359](<validation_messages.html#359>) will be raised.  
  
If Method is defined as Flat, then the system will compare the _numeric_ difference between the Principal Call Amount and the Counterparty Call Amount to the SplitToleranceMethod and evaluate whether to incorporate splitting in the calculation of Agreed amounts  
  
When Method is defined as Flat but either Currency or Amount is missing, [validation message 363](<validation_messages.html#363>) will be raised.  
  
If Method is defined as Percent of Call Amount, then the system will compare the _percentage_ difference between the Principal Call Amount and the Counterparty Call Amount to SplitToleranceMethod and evaluate whether to incorporate splitting in the calculation of Agreed amounts  
  
When Method is defined as Percentage but the Amount is missing, [validation message 362](<validation_messages.html#362>) will be raised.  
Source Reference (only displayed on read-only form) | SourceReference | No | Char (255) | 856365 | The Source Reference is the unique identifier for the collateral agreement in the system from which the agreements data will be received.

Margin Valuation Frequency | ValuationFreq | No - but see notes | Char (25) | Acceptable Values  
  
\- Daily  
  
\- Exact  
  
\- Weekly  
  
\- Monthly  
  
Considerations for this field:  
  
\- If value = Exact,ValuationFreqExactDates needs to be populated.  
  
\- If Value = Weekly, ValuationFreqDayOfWeek  
needs to be populated.  
  
\- If Value = Monthly  
  
\- InterestPaymentCalendarType  
  
and  
  
\- ValuationFreqMonths  
need to be populated.  
  
Additionally, depending on ValuationFreqCalendarType  
  
definition, either  
  
ValuationFreqDayOfMonth  
  
or  
  
ValuationFreqWeekOfMonth  
  
need to be populated. | If this field is not supplied, the system will do the following:  
  
If an entry for this already exists for the agreement, it will be overwritten if the value is valid.  
  
\- If the import is inserting a new agreement - the system will set the value for the agreement to be Daily.  
  
In either case, if the value is invalid, it will ignore the value defined for any of these fields:  
  
\- ValuationFreqExactDates  
\- ValuationFreqDayOfWeek  
\- ValuationFreqDayOfMonth  
\- ValuationFreqCalendarType  
\- ValuationFreqMonths  
\- ValuationFreqWeekOfMonth  
  
If the value supplied is invalid, and the import is inserting a new agreement, the agreement will be created with a default value of Daily and [validation message 401](<validation_messages.html#401>) will be raised.  
  
If the import is amending a record and the value is incorrect then the existing record will be untouched, but the same validation message will be raised.  
  
It is therefore recommended that the field be populated.  
  
**Note:** When the Valuation Frequency is set to Weekly or Monthly, the Starting Date will always default to the import date and the Business Day Adjustment will always default to Next.  
Margin Valuation Frequency Exact Dates | ValuationFreqExactDates | No - but see notes | Char (1000) | 27/10/2020 | When ValuationFreqExactDate is defined as Exact, record in this field the exact dates for the valuation, using the date format specified in the agreement configuration.  
  
Numerous dates can be specified using a sub-delimiter.  
  
**Note:** If an invalid date is specified, the system will raise [validation message 409](<validation_messages.html#409>) and the system will default Valuation Frequency period to be Daily if this a new agreement. If this is an amendment to the agreement, the value in the database will remain the same.  
  
If duplicate dates are supplied in this field for the same agreement, [validation message 410](<validation_messages.html#410>) is raised, and one of the duplicates is loaded.  
  
**Note:** If values are supplied for this field, that any existing exact dates in the system will be replaced with those specified in the import file.  
Margin Valuation Frequency - weekly selection | ValuationFreqDayOfWeek | No - but see notes | Char (25) | Monday

If this value is not supplied then the system will raise [validation message 403](<validation_messages.html#403>)  
  
If the import is creating an agreement (insert) then if missing the system will default the valuation frequency to be Daily.  
  
If the import is amending an existing agreement (update), and this field is blank, then the existing day of week in database will be unchanged.  
  
If an invalid day of week is included in the import file, [validation message 404](<validation_messages.html#404>) is raised. If an existing day of the week exists for the agreement in the system this will be untouched.  
  
**Note:** Although importable values [Monday → Sunday], only values of Monday → Friday are selectable via the GUI for Monthly Relative Day frequencies.  
Valuation Frequency - monthly selection | ValuationFreqDayOfMonth | No - but see notes | Char (25) | 1st, 2nd, 3rd...Last  
  
If ValuationFrequencyCalendarType = Calendar Day values can be 1st, 2nd...31st or Last  
  
ValuationFrequencyCalendarType = Business Day values can be 1st, 2nd...23rd or Last | When Valuation Frequency is defined as Monthly and ValuationFrequencyCalendarType is defined as either CalendarDay or BusinessDay, this field needs to be populated.  
  
If an incorrect value is specified - e.g. 12st or no value is included, then [validation message 402](<validation_messages.html#402>) is raised and newly inserted agreements will be created with a default value of Daily.  
  
If the import is amending a record and the value is incorrect then the existing record will be untouched, but the same validation message will be raised.  
Valuation Frequency - monthly selection | ValuationFreqCalendarType | No - but see notes | Char (25) | Calendar Day  
  
Business Day  
  
Relative Day | When Valuation Frequency is defined as Monthly this field needs to be populated.  
  
If it is incorrectly populated, newly inserted agreements will have the Valuation Frequency set to Daily and receive [validation message 402](<validation_messages.html#402>).  
  
If the import is amending a record and the value is incorrect then the existing record will be untouched, but the same validation message will be raised.  
Valuation Frequency - monthly selection | ValuationFreqMonths | No - but see notes | Char (500) | January  
  
February...December  
  
Alternatively - ALL will populate all months. | When Valuation Frequency is defined as Monthly this field needs to be populated.  
  
Specific Months can be defined by specifying a sub delimiter in the config file.  
  
Alternatively, including ALL as the value for this will populate all months.  
  
If not month is specified, or an invalid month is specified, [validation message 402](<validation_messages.html#402>) will be raised and newly inserted agreements will be defaulted to be Valuation Frequency of Daily.  
  
If the import is amending a record and the value is incorrect then the existing record will be untouched, but the same validation message will be raised.  
Valuation Frequency - monthly selection | ValuationFreqWeekOfMonth | No - but see notes | Char (25) | First  
  
Second  
  
Third  
  
Fourth  
  
Last | When Valuation Frequency is defined as Monthly and Valuation Frequency Calendar Type is defined as Relative Day this field needs to be populated to define which week within the month that the Valuation Frequency will occur.  
  
If the value is omitted or an incorrect value is supplied.  
  
[Validation message 402](<validation_messages.html#402>) will be raised, and newly inserted agreements will be defaulted to be Valuation Frequency of Daily.  
  
If the import is amending a record and the value is incorrect then the existing record will be untouched, but the same validation message will be raised.  
  
**Note:** When agreements are inserted as a result of an import the "new trade type behavior" field on the Trade Types tab is set to excluded by default. There are no checks done on the import to see whether an agreement already exists for the same Principal, Counterparty and Trade Type combination. If agreements exist with overlapping Trade Type combinations for the same Principal and Counterparty, problems will could occur when running the Trade Assignment task, as there may be trades that could be assigned to more than one agreement. In this case, relevant validation messages would indicate the issues after running the Trade Assignment Task.

As not all of the agreement data can be inserted using an import it may be necessary to review new agreements in order that any remaining data can be completed manually. Newly created agreements can be found by using the "Created Since" filtering option on the agreement screen.
