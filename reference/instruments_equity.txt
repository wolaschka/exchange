# Equity Instruments

Instrument data can be manually entered into the Instruments screen or loaded into the system from a file. Data which is entered manually will be overwritten if the same Instrument is also loaded from a file.

When an equity instrument is viewed, created or edited, it will contain 6 tabs of information. Each tab is described below.

**Note:** Fields in red are required.

## General

Section | Field | Description  
---|---|---  
**Identification** | Primary Id Type | The Instrument Identifier which is considered the primary ID for the instrument. The available values are ISIN, CUSIP, SEDOL and Internal ID. One of these must be defined as the Primary Id Type. Once the Primary ID Type has been selected, the corresponding Id becomes a mandatory field. It is this Id which will be displayed on the Instruments grid, Collateral Position Statements, and Collateral Notices. Additionally, in certain areas within the system wherever Instruments can be selected, only Primary ID type can be entered.  
  
Example: In the concentration rule builder.  
  
Validation is done against a combination of this field and the Instrument Identifier Type to ensure that the number of characters in the ID corresponds to the ID Type. (ISIN, CUSIP and SEDOL).  
  
Where the Instrument Identifier Type is Internal, validation checks that this ID does not correspond to an existing ISIN, CUSIP or SEDOL.  
| ISIN | A unique identifier for securities that requires 12 characters which can include spaces, numbers and symbols and is required when the Primary ID Type is set to ISIN.  
| CUSIP | A unique identifier for securities that requires 9 characters which can include spaces, numbers and symbols and is required when the Primary ID Type is set to CUSIP.  
| SEDOL | A unique identifier for securities that requires 7 characters which can include spaces, numbers and symbols and is required when the Primary ID Type is set to SEDOL.  
| Internal | A unique identifier for securities that can have up to 30 characters which can include spaces, numbers and symbols and is required when the Primary ID Type is set to Internal.  
| Description | A free form field where a written representation of the instrument can be specified.  
| Cost of Funding | Allows the user to optionally record a numeric value which represents the internal cost of funding the instrument. This field can accommodate 19 digits which includes 2 decimal places.  
| Currency | The currency in which the instrument is denominated.  
| Instrument Type | User defined value which is used to group types of instruments together.  
| Issuer | The issuer of the instrument.  
| Stock Index | The Index that the equity instrument is classified under.  
| Exchange | Principal exchange on which the instrument is traded. For example, London Stock Exchange.  
| Minimum Lot | Allows the user to record the minimum amount of the Instrument which can be transferred. This field, if populated, is used to calculate and validate entries for collateral movements. (Please see notes below for validation rules on this field.)  
| Lot Increment | Allows the user to record the incremental amount in which the Instrument can be transferred. Like Minimum Lot, it is used to calculate and validate collateral movements entries. (Please see notes below for validation rules on this field.)  
| Price Terms | There are two choices:  
  
**Actual** \- Will use the price as provided in determining the value.  
Example:  
If price is 34, and notional is 1,000,000 value will be 1,000,000 * 34 = 34,000,000.  
  
This is the default market standard for equity instruments.  
  
**Percentage** \- price entered is interpreted as a percentage, and is effectively divided by 100 when deriving value.  
Example:  
Price = $25.3  
Notional = 1,000,000  
Market Value = (1M * 25.3)/100 = $253,000  
**Instrument Ratings** | Debt Structure | Select a debt structure from the drop-down menu. The possible choices are Long Term, Short Term, Financial and Internal.  
| Agency | Select the relevant agency from the drop-down menu. The available choices are defined in the reference data under [rating agencies](<reference.html#adding-reference-data>).  
  
**Note:** It is not possible to mix and match debt structures and ratings.  
| Rating | Select the current rating for the relevant Agency from the drop-down menu. The available choices are defined in the reference data under[rating equivalencies](<reference_related_data.html#ratings-equivalencies>)
