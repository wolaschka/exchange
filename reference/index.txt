  * Powerful intuitive interface - enhances risk-informed decision making by presenting clear and logical paths for users

  * Comprehensive and flexible data management - automated data capture and analysis to help meet the diverse needs of multiple collateral management programs

  * Streamlined back office workflow - automation of key tasks associated with margin call processing, including data capture, validation, calculation and processing

  * Collateral optimization - enables automated selection of collateral assets to enhance automation and reduce funding costs
