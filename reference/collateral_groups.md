# Collateral Groups

## Search Criteria

The collateral groups can be viewed by selecting groups from the navigation pane.

There are two ways to return bucket data.

  1. To return all collateral groups within the screen, click on the search button.

  2. To return a subset of collateral groups based on a name within the search field, enter all or part of the collateral group name. The field is case insensitive and an asterisk can be used as a wild card. Select the **Search** button to return the data.




**Note:** To clear the search criteria, the data needs to be manually removed.

## Grid Features

The collateral group grid can be [sorted](<grid_features.md#sorting>), [paged](<grid_features.md#paging>), [exported](<grid_features.md#export-grid>), [reorder columns](<grid_features.md#reorder-columns>), and fields can be [disabled or resized](<grid_features.md#display-and-resizing-columns>).

## Collateral Groups Grid View

**Note:** Fields in red are required. The collateral group will not save until all required fields have values.

Field | Information  
---|---  
Name | Enter the group name. This name will be selected in concentration rules and referenced throughout the system so the name should be meaningful but kept short if possible.  
Buckets | Click the drop-down and select one, multiple or all buckets.  
  
At least one Bucket must be selected in order to save the collateral group.  
  
Buckets can be removed from the Items Selected list by double-clicking on the item that needs to be removed or select **Clear All**.  
  
Collateral Groups are [audited](<audit.md>) in the standard manner.
