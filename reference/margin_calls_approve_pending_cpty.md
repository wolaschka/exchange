# Approve Pending Counterparty

When the **Approve Pending Counterparty** button is selected, the call is moved to the **In Progress** filter with a workflow state of **Pending Cpty**.

This will put the call in a state that requires an indication that the counterparty also approves.

The options available within this state are the following:

  * **Counterparty Accepts** \- call will transition to a **Confirmed** state.
  * **Counterparty Rejects** \- the user will be prompted for a Reject Comment. After the reject comment is entered, the Reject button will become enabled. The call will then transition to an **Agreed** state when the button is clicked.
