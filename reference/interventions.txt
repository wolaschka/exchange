This component is sold as a separate license from TLM Collateral Management. Please see your TLM Collateral Management representative if a license is needed.

## Overview

TLM Collateral Messaging Intervention tool provides a view of errors that are published for the electronic messages by TLM Collateral Management and TLM Collateral Management Adapters. Errors are published and subscribed to by the Public API. TLM Collateral Intervention calls the Negotiation service to get error information and display it in a website for a user to determine mitigation steps.

## Search Criteria

Data can be returned with no search criteria, some or all search criteria entered.

There are several ways to return Interventions data.

  * To return all error messages, click on the **Search** button.
  * To filter on a set list of error types, select an error type from the drop-down.
  * To filter based on a specific date range, select a _From Date_ and/or a _To Date_ by clicking on the calendar icon. Or the date(s) can be manually entered.
    * Choosing a From date of today and To date of tomorrow will bring all errors within a range of start of day of the From date until the end of day of the To date (ex. 06/12/2022 00:00:00 to 06/13/2022 11:59:59)
    * The range will be translated from the time of the machine where the website is displayed to UTC and errors within that range will be displayed in UTC



To clear the search criteria, select the **Clear Filters** button.

## Grid Features

The Triparty grid can be [sorted](<grid_features.html#sorting>), [paged](<grid_features.html#paging>), [exported](<grid_features.html#export-grid>), [reorder columns](<grid_features.html#reorder-columns>), and fields can be [disabled or resized](<grid_features.html#display-and-resizing-columns>).

## Grid View

When data is returned on the Interventions screen, the page will display the following fields with data that meets the search criteria in a grid.

Reprocessing| Some error events are eligible for reprocessing. (ex. Margin Call Not Found, Instrument Not Found) The TLM Collateral application can be adjusted for the event that had originally errored (run margin calcs, update missing instrument) and when ready, the event can be reprocessed.

b. Once selected, the button will no longer be available, as the event has been reprocessed.
