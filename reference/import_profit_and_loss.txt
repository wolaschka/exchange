# File Format for Profit and Loss

## Background

TLM® Collateral Management allows the import of Profit and Loss (P&L) information for Agreements.

P&L information is made up of:

  * A P&L _type_. 
  * The cash _currency_ and _amount_ of the P&L. 
  * The _Party_ to whom the P&L should be paid. 
  * The _Settlement Date_ on which the P&L should be paid



Specifically, six types of P&L can be imported.

  * _CashFlow_
  * _CCPFee_
  * _ClearingMemberFees_
  * _Consideration_
  * _Coupon_
  * _Price Aligned Interest_



P&L amounts, once imported, are converted into collateral movements for the corresponding Agreement. See [Understanding How Collateral Movements are Created from P&L](<understanding_p_and_l.html>) import for more information regarding this process.

## Scope of Applicability

The Profit and Loss Import can be used to import P&L for Agreements in the following Business Lines:

**Central Clearing** \- But only where the Margin Type of the Agreement is Variation. 

**Client Clearing** \- But only where the Margin Type of the Agreement is Variation. 

**OTC** \- Imported P&L amounts will create movements with a margin type of Variation. 

## Restrictions

P&L cannot be imported for:

  * Repo or Securities Lending Agreements. 
  * Central Clearing and Client Clearing Agreements with a Margin Type other than Variation. 
  * Agreements that have simultaneous held and posted Collateral positions in the cash currency of the P&L amount to be imported. 
  * Closed Interest Periods. That is P&L amounts for an Agreement / CCY combination cannot be imported with a settlement date that falls within a closed interest period for the same Agreement / CCY combination. 



**Note:** The system does not validate the posting party on an Agreement when importing P&L Information and creating the corresponding collateral movements. Therefore for Unilateral Agreements this could, under certain circumstances, lead to erroneous collateral positions (for example creation of delivery collateral movement to the Posting Party), and potentially margin calculation anomalies. It is therefore recommended that P&L amounts are not imported for Unilateral Agreements.

## Import Type

When importing Profit and Loss Information, no previously imported records (or their corresponding collateral movements) are deleted.

## Import Process

When the Profit and Loss Import task runs, the following processes occur:

  1. The system validates the P&L details defined in the import file. 
  2. Where a P&L amount is successfully validated, the system creates a corresponding collateral movement for the Agreement. 

Note that each data row in the import file can contain up to six P&L types and amounts for a Single Agreement.

During the Import Process the system applies logic in determining whether to create the corresponding collateral movements as delivery or return movements (Based on whether the current collateral position** is held or posted and which Party's favor the P&L movements are in). This can result in a single P&L amount being split into two collateral movements as the collateral position flips from Held to Posted or vice versa.

See [Understanding Collateral Movements created from P&L import](<understanding_p_and_l.html>).

Conceptually the key point to understand is that although each data row in the import file can contain up to six P&L types and amounts for a Single Agreement, it can create up to a maximum of seven collateral movements.

**Posted Collateral Positions for Asset Pools are ignored in this determination. Only Internal (i.e. no defined Asset Pool) are considered.

  3. Collateral Movements created from imported P&L are created with a Settlement State of In Transit, and are therefore included in Margin Calculations for the corresponding Agreements. Similarly, they are subject to processing by the settle movements task. 

  4. Collateral Movements created from imported P&L are identifiable as they have a Movement Type of **Profit and Loss**. Additionally, the field P&L type denotes what type of P&L the Collateral Movement originates from.
