# File Format for Collateral Buckets

When importing Collateral Buckets all previous records are not deleted when a new import is run. If a file contains a record for a Collateral Bucket which already exists in the database, that record is updated. If a file contains a record for a Collateral Bucket which does not yet exist in the database, that record is added.

When a field is not imported correctly during the import process (for example, the Currency supplied does not match an existing currency in the database) the record is not imported. This is to prevent incomplete buckets from being created in the system.

Issue Date Band | IssueDateBandLowerOperator | No, but note the following:  
  
Issue Date Band information can only be imported when InstrumentClass is defined as Debt. If this is defined as Equity valuation message 313 is raised and the record is discarded.  
  
Furthermore, If one of the Issue date band values is supplied all corresponding values need to be specified in order for the system to calculate whether the band is valid.  
  
For example, if IssueDateBandLowerOperator  
  
is supplied, then IssueDateBandLowerOrdinal and IssueDateBandLowerTimePeriod  
  
are required.  
  
If the corresponding values are not supplied, then validation message 316 is raised.  
  
Additionally, if all values are specified but the period is invalid, for example, the upper issue date limit is less than the lower limit, validation message 314 will also be raised.  
  
If any validation causes a data value to be excluded which then results in an invalid date band definition then validation message 315 is raised.  
  
All above validation failures will result in the record not importing. | Char(50) |  | This is the operator which is used to define the lower element of the Issue Date rating band. The choices available are:
