# Resend Margin Call Notices

## Overview

Margin Call Notices can be resent from the following states:

  * Demand Workflow - Sent
  * Anticipated Demands Workflow - Sent SVA
  * Grouped Workflow - Sent



This may be necessary if the counterpart has not received, or has misplaced the Margin Notice, or if the transmission of the Notice failed and the cause of that failure has now been remedied.

## Resend Notices

**Procedure**

To resend Margin Call Notices for Demands or Anticipated Demands:

  1. Navigate to _In Progress_ Workflow for either _Sent_ or _Sent SVA_ Anticipated Demands.
  2. Select the check box to the left of the Agreement in the grid.
  3. Click on the **More** button and select **Resend Call(s)**.



The Margin Call notice will be sent to all those [contacts on the Agreement](<contactinfo.md#contact-information>) who are configured to receive the notice.

Additionally, should a contact be configured to receive a margin call notice together with other notices, then resending the margin notice will cause all the associated notices to be sent to the contact. See [How to Define a Contact](<contactinfo.md#contact-information>) for details.
